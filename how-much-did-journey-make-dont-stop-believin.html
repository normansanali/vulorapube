Its reappearance on the charts in 2009 was thanks to the breathtaking performance of the misfit Glee Club in the pilot episode of Glee.</p><p>The phenomenal reentering each time the song is covered or used as a soundtrack in films and TV shows proves that "Don't Stop Believin'" is an anthem song that fits any era. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Don't Stop Believin'" is a power ballad that will always be needed, no matter the age or time</a>.</p><p>According to Journey's keyboardist, Jonathan Cain, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Don't Stop Believin" was a song for every person who wants to make it</a>.
