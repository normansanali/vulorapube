She is known for portraying diverse roles in her acting career. Furthermore, she has also made a good name for herself in the investment field. As a result, the actress has gained immense fame and popularity.</p><p>Jami is still involved in the acting business, and she must be enjoying a comfortable life from her hard-earned fortune. So, in this article, we will be discussing Jami Gertz’s net worth, including her earnings and income sources.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jami_Gertz_Net_Worth_And_Earnings></span>Jami Gertz Net Worth And Earnings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Born in Chicago, Illinois, Jami started acting professionally in 1981 and is still actively working in the entertainment industry. Apart from that, she co-owns an NBA team and has invested in several sectors. Combining all the ventures that she has been involved in, it can be assumed that she must be earning significantly.</p><p>Therefore, as per&nbsp;Celebrity Net Worth, Jami Gertz’s net worth is $3 billion. Likewise, Wealthy Gorilla estimates her riches to be $2 billion. While the amount may vary, it seems Jami has amassed billions to her name. Now, let’s learn how she was able to amass such a huge fortune.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Earnings_As_An_Actress></span>Earnings As An Actress<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>While attending Maine East High School, Jami was discovered by <strong>Norman Lear</strong>‘s company. As a child actor, she appeared in one episode of&nbsp;Different Strokes. In 1981, she made her film debut with Endless Love. She has since acted in several other projects. Here are some of the movies that Jami has acted in and <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">their box office</a> collections.</p><table id=detail_table><tr><th>Movies</th><th>Box Office Collections</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>Quicksilver</td><td>$5.6M</td></tr><tr><td>Less Than Zero</td><td>$10.8M</td></tr><tr><td>The Lost Boys</td><td>$31.7M</td></tr><tr><td>Sibling Rivalry</td><td>$16.8M</td></tr><tr><td>Twister</td><td>$241.7M</td></tr><tr><td>Keeping Up With the Steins</td><td>$4.3M</td></tr><tr><td>A Better Life</td><td>$1.8M</td></tr></tbody></table><p style=text-align:right>Table Source: Rotten Tomatoes</p><p>Considering how her movies have grossed millions, Jami Gertz’s salary must have been significant. Apart from movies, she has also appeared in several television series. In 1982, she made her TV debut in Square Pegs. Following that, Gertz featured in The Facts of Life, Dreams, Sibs, ER, Ally McBeal, Still Standing, Entourage, The Neighbors, etc.</p><p>An actress earns $103,388 annually as an average salary. Hence, Jami must have earned significantly in over three decades of her acting career. Therefore, Jami Gertz’s net worth must have increased over the years.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Learn About One Of The Richest MLB Owners, Mark Attanasio</a></strong></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Earnings_From_Other_Ventures></span>Earnings From Other Ventures<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As mentioned earlier, apart from acting, the gorgeous lady has also been involved in the banking world. She and her husband, <strong>Antony Ressler,</strong> are part-owners of the NBA team Atlanta Hawks. Furthermore, they are also members of <strong>Mark Attanasio</strong>-led investment group, which purchased the MLB franchise Milwaukee Brewers.</p><p>In addition, Jami sits on the boards of several non-profit companies like Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and Campbell Hall Episcopal School. She also co-founded Painted Turtle Camp, an organization that pays for kids with fatal and chronic illnesses on camping trips.</p><p>As a famous actress, the Hawks co-owner must have been approached by several brands to sign endorsement deals, and she might have done so with a few of them. These endorsements and sponsorships must have significantly benefitted Jami Gertz’s net worth. Hence, looking at her earnings, Jami’s fortune of $3 billion seems reasonable.</p><p>On the other hand, Jami Gertz’s husband, Antony Ressler’s riches are also $3 billion. Hence the husband-wife duo must be enjoying a luxurious life together.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lifestyle_And_Assets></span>Lifestyle And Assets<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Antony Ressler’s wife’s fortune is reportedly $3 billion. All thanks to her multi-billion fortune, she must be living a comfortable lifestyle. She resides in Los Angeles, California, with her spouse and kids, <strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Oliver Jordan Ressler</a>, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Nicholas Simon Ressler</a></strong>, and <strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Theo Ressler.</a></strong>&nbsp;Furthermore, the couple has homes in Malibu and Beverly Hills.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jami-Gertz-sons-and-husband.jpg><p>As per Tax records, the house in which Jami resides is worth a minimum of $30 million. Furthermore, it has been reported that the Gertz-Ressler couple owns over $100 million worth of real estate in LA. In addition, Jami might have a great collection of branded cars.</p><p>Hence, Jami and Tony must be living contently. Let’s hope her fortune increases in the coming days and Jami Gertz continues enjoying a comfortable life.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Trivia_And_Facts></span>Trivia And Facts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Gertz-Ressler High Academy, which is a member of Alliance College-Ready Public Schools, is named for Jami and her husband.</li><li>Jami, along with her hubby, was named the No.1 donor to a charity of any celebrity by The Giving Back Fund.</li><li>Antony Ressler’s wife was considered for the role of Rachel Green on the popular television series Friends, which eventually went to <strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong>.</li></ul><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><i>For More Updates On&nbsp;</i></span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Celebrity Babies</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Feuds</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Their Riches</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Siblings</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, And&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Entertainment</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, Keep In Touch With&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>eCelebritymirror.</span></strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeinrCpsdKtZJydnJqvs7XTopysZ5qWuqp5xp6prbJdo7K1edaoqa2gXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jesus-manuel-corona.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jess Manuel Corona - Age, Career, Married, Net Worth, Facts">&larr;
