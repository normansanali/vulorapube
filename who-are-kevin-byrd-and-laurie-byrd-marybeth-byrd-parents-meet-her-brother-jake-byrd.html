Her fame immediately increased after that, and a huge number of people began to follow her every move.</p><p>Byrd has always had a strong affinity for music, and from an early age, she began to pursue a career in it. It came as no surprise when, at the age of 11, she released “Don’t Look the Other Way,” her debut country hit.</p><p>Many were astounded by her voice and her apparent skill, and they couldn’t believe she was so young. Yet Marybeth didn’t become well-known until she participated in the national singing competition “The Voice.”</p><p>During her blind audition, she rotated all four chairs, which seldom ever happens on the program. Marybeth made the decision to work with John Legend as her coach after giving it some thought. He saw her potential and supported her throughout the competition.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=marybeth-byrd-parents-kevin-and-laurie-byrd-brother-jake-byrd></span>Marybeth Byrd Parents Kevin And Laurie Byrd- Brother Jake Byrd<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Marybeth Byrd was born on April 12, 2001, to her parents, Laurie Franklin Byrd and Kevin Byrd. She developed a love for music as a result of growing up in this beautiful region of the United States, which would later influence other aspects of her life.</p><p>Marybeth Byrd parents claim that she started singing when she was just three years old, indicating how deeply interwoven music is in Mary’s life. She worked on her vocals for about ten years.</p><p>Jake Byrd is Mary’s brother, but the singer hasn’t spoken anything about him yet. It appears from his Instagram that he enjoys driving jeeps and cars.</p><p>Mary has been dating&nbsp;Christian Gunnels since 2016. She doesn’t hesitate to grab Gunnels’ hand in public and doesn’t try to hide anything about her private life.</p><p>Christian is likewise quite proud of his girlfriend and has no qualms about calling her his future bride. They routinely share photos of themselves on social media.</p><p>Therefore, Marybeth Byrd parents are very proud of their daughter, who is successful and famous at a very young age.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=more-about-marybeth-byrd-musical-career></span>More About Marybeth Byrd Musical Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Marybeth resumed her “The Voice” journey and advanced to the semifinals, placing her among the top eight candidates. She was regrettably eliminated from the singing competition show a week before the semester ended.</p><p>Mary was honored for her talent at the 2021 Arkansas Country Music Awards when she won Young Artist of the Year. Her ultimate goal, according to her website, is to inspire aspiring young vocalists.</p><p>On Sunday, March 5’s broadcast of American Idol, radio personality Marybeth stunned the judges with her immaculate country-pop twang.</p><p>She stated in her American Idol audition for episode three of season 21 that she is prepared for “the next chapter” of her life and career.</p><p>She added some “pop flare” when she sang “If It Hadn’t Been for Love” by The SteelDrivers. Her twang, control, and range quickly astounded Lionel Richie, Katy Perry, and Luke Bryan.</p><p>The three judges applauded the contestant after the performance. Richie referred to her performance as “accurate — period.” Byrd “brought [her] identity” to the audition room, he later noted. Marybeth has a “promising future,” according to Luke Bryan.</p><p>With their mutual love of country music, Bryan appeared to be the judge who was most enthusiastic about Byrd out of the three. She was perfect in every way, he assured Byrd, and she had it “from the first note.”</p><p>Viewers will have to wait and see what Marybeth Byrd does next on American Idol.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqivsRmop6umaN6o8XRnWSappRiuaLB0aKcZpqpp7FuucCrsJudpJ16o8XRnWSpmaKau7W%2FjKacnqxdnbKzecGrpq2glad6q63KnmSbsaKZfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./232068-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Lauren Cimorelli Dating Now?
