Fans have linked her with her co-stars from Never Have I Ever, Darren Basnet and Jaren Lewison, but none of the rumors came true. Also in 2023, she seems to be single and hasn't revealed her relationship details.</strong></p><p>You may recall <strong>Maitreyi Ramakrishnan </strong>from her work on the popular teen comedy Netflix series "Never Have I Ever." 'Never Have I Ever' is age comedy-drama television series that was created by <strong>Lang Fisher</strong> and <strong>Mindy Kaling</strong> and centers around Devi Vishwakumar. Devi, a teenage Indian-American who had a terrible first year in school, wants to change her life.</p><p>With her increasing popularity, the <a href=#><strong>actress</strong></a>, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan has gained fans attention. Fans have shown interest in learning about her boyfriend, especially about the one that was in 2021. So was she in a relationship in 2021, and is she single or has a boyfriend now? Let us get into detail.</p><p>Previously, we discussed the <a href=#><strong>relationship status</strong></a> of <a href=#><strong>Jim Gaffigan</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Tim Durham</strong></a>.</p><h2>Maitreyi Ramakrishnan Didn’t Have a Boyfriend Since 2021!</h2><p>Who was <strong>Maitreyi Ramakrishnan</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@maitreyiramakrishnan</a>) dating in 2021, and why has her relationship made fans confused? For her outstanding performance as Devi Vishwakumar in the Netflix teen comedy series <a href=# rel=noopener>Never Have I Ever</a> (2020–2023), the actress has received praise. She, along with other well-known individuals, was selected as one of the brand ambassadors for the well-known clothing retailer American Eagle's "Member's Always: Future Together" campaign in March 2022. Now, let us discuss her <a href=# rel=noopener>dating life</a> details of 2021.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/06/maitreyi-ramakrishnan-boyfriend-2021-2.jpg alt="Maitreyi Ramakrishnan didn't have a boyfriend in 2021. celebsindepth.com" width=576 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Maitreyi Ramakrishnan didn't have a boyfriend in 2021.<br></strong><strong>Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>Maitreyi Ramakrishnan didn't have a boyfriend back in 2021. Back in the year, she was a 20-year-old girl who was just rising in fame with her show, Never Have I Ever. She has succeeded in keeping her relationship situation a secret. She hasn't mentioned having a significant other and hasn't been seen out and about with anyone romantically. She didn't drop any hints regarding her partner in 2021.</p><p>Also Her social media pages offered no hints as to whom she was dating either. She prefers keeping her relationship affairs private. Many fans linked her with her costar, <strong>Darren Barnet </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@darrenbasnet</a>). Some have even questioned whether Maitreyi Ramakrishnan and Jaren Lewison's relationship.</p><h2>Meet Maitreyi Ramakrishnan’s Rumored Boyfriend, Darren Basnet, and Jaren Lewison Since 2021!</h2><p>As the coronavirus outbreak was still continuing when the first season of the Netflix series, Never Have I Ever, debuted. Fans were smitten by Devi, a fictional high school student, right away for her straightforward approach to handling her love life. In addition to connecting with <strong>Maitreyi Ramakrishnan</strong>'s role, viewers also adored her relationship with her co-stars, <strong>Darren Barnet</strong> (Paxton) and <strong>Jaren Lewison</strong> (Ben) (<a href=# rel=noopener>@jarenlewison</a>). Fans began linking and wondered if she was either dating Darren or Jaren since 2021.</p><p>Some have even questioned whether Maitreyi Ramakrishnan and Darren Barnet are dating since their on-screen chemistry is so strong. The Never Have I Ever cast members are single. They are just friends. I understand that their smoldering on-screen chemistry might lead you to believe otherwise, but they are simply not more than friends in real life.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/06/maitreyi-ramakrishnan-boyfriend-2021-1.jpg alt="Maitreyi Ramakrishnan was rumored to be dating Darren Basnet. celebsindepth.com" width=576 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Maitreyi Ramakrishnan was rumored to be dating Darren Basnet.<br></strong><strong>Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>In reality, the actor made his red-carpet debut in August 2021 at the Los Angeles premiere of The Suicide Squad alongside girlfriend, <strong>Mikaela Hoover</strong>. Before entering the event, the pair posed together and loaded the PDA for the photographers. Darren wore a black suit, while his partner opted for a glam two-piece ensemble. In 2021, the couple made their relationship public by sharing birthday greetings for one another. It looks like Darren is no longer dating his girlfriend and is instead single.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/06/maitreyi-ramakrishnan-boyfriend-2021-3.jpg alt="Fans linked Maitreyi Ramakrishnan with Jaren Lewison in 2021. celebsindepth.com" width=1214 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1214px) 100vw, 1214px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Fans linked Maitreyi Ramakrishnan with Jaren Lewison in 2021.<br></strong><strong>Source: Instagram</strong></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>Also, there were rising rumors that Maitreyi Ramakrishnan might be dating <strong>Jaren Lewison</strong>. Fans were drawn to the connection between Ramakrishnan and Jaren Lewison, who played her boyfriend Ben Gross in Never Have I Ever, since 2021, but there is no proof to back up the rumors of a real-life relationship between the two actors.</p><h2>Maitreyi Ramakrishnan Seems to Have Been Single Since 2021!</h2><p>Speaking about <strong>Maitreyi Ramakrishnan</strong>'s boyfriend in 2023, she doesn't seem to have. The actress tends to keep her private affairs quiet in real life, and she hasn't publicly acknowledged having a boyfriend. She did not give the impression that this was her first time acting in Never Have I Ever, and her excellent talent and representation of the complicated character won her praise from the critics and a devoted fan base. So she might be focusing on her career.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/06/maitreyi-ramakrishnan-boyfriend-2023-1.jpg alt="Maitreyi Ramakrishnan is single in 2023. celebsindepth.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Maitreyi Ramakrishnan is single in 2023.<br></strong><strong>Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>Maitreyi Ramakrishnan's hasn't mentioned having a significant other and hasn't been seen out and about with anyone romantically.
