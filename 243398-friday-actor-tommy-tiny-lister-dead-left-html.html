Take a look at some of their sweetest memories.</p><p class=Fg>A highly accomplished actor and a former pro wrestler, Tommy "Tiny" Lister was a gifted soul packed in a 6' 5" frame. Throughout <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001474/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">his career</a>, he worked with top-notch actors and directors in diverse genres.</p><p class=Fg>The world was shaken when the beloved "Friday" star lost his life on December 10, 2020, due to COVID-19 complications, but he is survived by his only daughter, Faith Grace, and wife, Felicia Forbes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/dc4a1cd3673916165dbab0f9d3b8c4c3.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Tommy "Tiny" Lister onstage at A3C Hip & Conference on October 11, 2015 in Atlanta, Georgia. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>Lister allegedly fathered another child, a son named Thomas Duane Lister III, but it has not been publicly confirmed. Meanwhile, it was no secret that he was a great father to his daughter. Let's take a look at some of their best memories.</p><p class=Fg>This <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CCH9IqigNUO/>photo</a> of Lister and Faith dates back to July 20, 2020. Lister looks on while his daughter appears to be talking to someone who is not in the frame. The duo is wearing sweatshirts with a printed photo of the actor.</p><p class=Fg>In this <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.instagram.com/p/CDH9eaLg5Yc/>photo</a> from July 27, a woman is seen holding a younger Faith who looks cute in a yellow jacket and a white tee. Lister did not caption it, but he did enlighten his fans on who the woman was in the comments.</p><p class=Fg>Apparently, she was his movie manager, Cindy Cowan, and one of the godmothers to Faith when she was young. Lister went on to count his blessings and expressed gratitude for everything he has.</p><p class=Fg>This July 28 snap will melt hearts into puddles. Lister and Faith smile ear to ear as they posed for the selfie with a filter on. Some fans noted how similar the father and daughter duo looks.</p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>He wanted to spend the holidays with his daughter at home, eating and watching basketball games.</strong></h3><p class=Fg>On August 19, Lister shared a <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CECrTZ3AR4G/>picture</a> of her daughter hanging out with two of her friends in her room. She looked as adorable as ever with her infectious smile.</p><p class=Fg>The girls seemed to be gearing up to watch something on the big tablet that Faith held. The photo gives a warm and carefree vibe, which goes to show how intimate the bond between Faith and Lister was.</p><p class=Fg>This Halloween <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CHE1z1LAr2a/>shot</a> was one of the last pictures the actor shared of Faith. She dressed up as a witch for the occasion, and clearly, her father was super proud of how she put the look together.</p><p class=Fg>In the final interview before his death, the actor <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9044859/Tommy-Tiny-Lister-vowed-Covid-vaccine-days-died-virus.html>looked visibly ill</a> as he spoke to DailyMailTV from his Marina Del Rey apartment. He talked about Hollywood and also shared he would take the vaccine for COVID-19.</p><p class=Fg>Lister also shared his Christmas plans during the interview. He wanted to spend the holidays with his daughter at home, eating and watching basketball games. Sadly, none of that could happen.</p><p class=Fg>In the words of his manager Cowan, Lister was like a big kid who loved to drink milk and eat cookies. She said the family plans to hold a celebration of life in 2021 when the <a class="Xd a" href=#>COVID-19</a> restrictions are relaxed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtrbGtpbXqnvsidmLJlkZjBsL6Mraampaliwaq62Gajoqukmr9usMSam2aklZvBb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./alabama-police-officers-shot-huntsville.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="1 Alabama officer shot and killed, another hospitalized in critical condition: Police">&larr;
