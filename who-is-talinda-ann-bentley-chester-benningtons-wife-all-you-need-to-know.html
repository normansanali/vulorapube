She attended the Los Angeles Music Academy, where she graduated in 1995.&nbsp;She then ventured into modeling in the early 2000s and eventually found considerable fame.&nbsp;Bentley came into the limelight when she was featured as a model in Playboy magazine’s College Girls section.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Talinda Ann Bentley – husband, children</span></strong></h2><p><span>Talinda Ann Bentley is the wife of ChesterBennington, the late Linkin Park singer.&nbsp;The couple met through a mutual friend, musician Ryan Shuck, in 2004 and began dating while Talinda was a model and Bennington was still married to his first wife Samantha Marie Olit.&nbsp;They tied the knot in 2005, shortly after Bennington’s divorce from Olit.</span></p><p><span>Talinda and Bennington’s union produced three children, a son Tyler Lee and twin daughters Lila and Lilly.&nbsp;Talinda is also stepmother to three other sons – Jaime from Bennington’s previous relationship with Elka Brand, Draven from his marriage to Samantha Olit and Isaiah, an adopted son.</span></p><span>The couple’s marriage was a seemingly sweet andenviable one while it lasted.&nbsp;After divorcing Chester, he claimed he was a broken man and credited Bentley with helping him overcome his battle with depression.&nbsp;According to Bennington, the divorce was one of the worst and best things that ever happened to him and left him so drained and bitter.&nbsp;In fact, the Linkin Park singer also dedicated the song some fresh air he needed at the time&nbsp;</span><span>Give Me Your Name</span><span>&nbsp;to his wife Talinda.</span><p><span>However, after 12 years of marriage, rock fans, and the music world at large, were shocked when the news broke that Talinda’s husband had taken his own life.&nbsp;The seemingly committed husband and father, who had just returned from visiting family in Arizona, left his loving wife and six children and hanged himself at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, California, on July 20, 2017.&nbsp;Chester Bennington was alone at his home when he died and his body was discovered by an employee.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Other facts</span></strong></h2><ul><li><strong><span>Height, weight and body measurements</span></strong></li></ul><p><span>Talinda Ann Bentley stands at an average height of 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 55 kg.&nbsp;Her body measurements are chest – 34 inches, waist – 28 inches and hips – 34 inches.</span></p><ul><li><strong><span>social media</span></strong></li></ul><p><span>She has an active social media life and a large following on popular online platforms like Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.</span></p><ul><li><strong><span>Magic Romance</span></strong></li></ul><p><span>Ten days after Bentley and Bennington’s whirlwind novels began in 2004, they moved in together and today the rest is history as the pair survived twelve loving long years together.</span></p><ul><li><strong><span>Cyberstalking victim</span></strong></li></ul><p><span>Bentley and Bennington were once victims of cyberstalking during their marriage.&nbsp;For about a year, a man named Devon Townsend harassed the couple, tampered with their personal information and threatened them.&nbsp;However, the couple’s life later returned to normal after the cyberstalker was found guilty and sentenced to two years in prison for his crime.</span></p><ul><li><strong><span>Chester Bennington</span></strong></li></ul><p><span>Before his death, Chester Bennington, the legendary rock frontman, was the vocalist for Linkin Park, the famed band known for redefining the nu metal and rap metal genres.&nbsp;Born on March 20, 1976 to Elaine and Lee Russell Bennington, Chester was an only child and had a difficult childhood after his parents separated in his teens.&nbsp;After the divorce, he was raised by his father.&nbsp;However, the divorce hit the rock star hard, further plunging him into the depression and drugs he struggled with for most of his life.&nbsp;Before his death, Chester Bennington had his net worth at $30 million.</span></p><p><span>Talinda and her family currently reside in Agoura Hills near Los Angeles, California.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMrZiloZ6Zrm6tzadkm52eqbmmxYycn56rpJq%2Fbq7Ep6WippepvK%2B%2FjLCgn51dlrmtediorGamlZqxbsDOZqKnp6dk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-was-shireta-rogers-age-biography-children-husband.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Was Shireta Rogers?
