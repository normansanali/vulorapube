Born in Flint, Michigan, the USA on January 19, 1988, JaVale turned professional by joining Washington Wizards in 2008.</p><p>This three-time NBA champion currently plays for Denver Nuggets. He had played for the team from 2012-2015 and rejoined the team in 2021.</p><p>Although we have discussed JaVale here, this article is more about his wife-to-be-girlfriend, <strong>Giselle Ramirez</strong>. We will try to explore who the girlfriend of this start player is and some facts about her. Also, read about her daughter.</p><h2><strong>Giselle Ramirez Wikipedia</strong></h2><p>Giselle Ramirez is a beautiful girl from El Salvador, Central America. Although her date of birth is not clear, it is assumed that she was born between 1988-1992.</p><p>This beautiful Latin American girl lives in the USA now. She is believed to be in a romantic relationship with Javale. However, not much information is available about this beautiful girl. It is unclear about her family background and early life.</p><p>She has graduated from the University of California with two degrees. We have no clear idea of what this girlfriend of the star athlete does. But following her on social media, we have found out that she loves to work out to keep her fit.</p><p>Many sources tell us that she is into the real estate business now and used to be a fitness model previously.</p><p>Giselle Ramirez Wikipedia page is not yet available.</p><h2><strong>Height, Weight, and Measurements.</strong></h2><p>Ramirez is about 5’ 8” tall with an attractive body stature. As she is a fitness freak, she has an incredibly athletic look. The beautiful girlfriend of JaVale attracts attention wherever she goes because of her astonishing physical features.</p><p>She has such a well-maintained and carefully sculpted figure that can slay any boy and make girls jealous. Although we do not know clearly about her body weight and other statistics, we can say that the girl has a killer figure.</p><h2><strong>JaVale McGee and Wife T0 Be Girlfriend Giselle Ramirez’s Relationship</strong></h2><p>The beautiful Latin American beauty is in a romantic relationship with <strong>JaVale McGee.</strong> We all know about JaVale as a star NBA player.</p><p>Although there is no clear information on how the two met, many believe that they met each other when JaVale was looking for a house. As a realtor, Giselle was in contact with JaVale and the two fell for each other.</p><p>Many sources tell us that the two have been in a relationship since 2015. Although the couple has no plan to get married any time soon, their relationship has been blessed with a beautiful daughter.</p><p>It is difficult to say who has been luckier in their relationship. While JaVale is an accomplished athlete, Giselle is an incredibly beautiful woman to be with the star player. It will be an injustice to say one is luckier. Instead, both complement each other.</p><h2><strong>Daughter, Genevieve Grey McGee</strong></h2><p>After a year of their relationship, the couple was blessed with a child. They had welcomed their daughter <strong>Genevieve Grey McGee</strong> in 2016. The two are enjoying their parenthood now with their daughter.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-2071 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritygen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Giselle-Ramirez-JaVale-McGee.jpg alt="Image of Realtor and Model, Giselle Ramirez with her family" width=450 height=562 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-2071 class=wp-caption-text>The gorgeous realtor and model, Giselle Ramirez with her daughter, Genevieve Grey McGee, and husband, JaVale McGee</p><h2><strong>Net Worth and Income Sources</strong></h2><p>It is believed that the beautiful girlfriend of GaVale has a net worth of $500K. However, there is no confirmed source to verify her net worth. What we can assume is as a realtor, she earns a hefty amount.</p><p>Apart from her income, she also enjoys the net worth of her star-athlete boyfriend. JaVale has a staggering net worth of $14 Million.</p><h2><strong>Social Media Activities</strong></h2><p>Giselle is an active user of <a href=#>Instagram</a> with more than 874 active followers.&nbsp;She posts regularly about real estate, fashion, and fitness on her account. She manages two accounts – a personal and a professional – on Instagram. Her persona account has more followers. The professional one seems to be a new account that is gaining followers slowly.</p><h2><strong>Wiki-Bio</strong></h2><table><tbody><tr><td width=139>Name</td><td width=246>Giselle Ramirez</td></tr><tr><td width=139>Date of Birth</td><td width=246>Not Confirmed</td></tr><tr><td width=139>Birth Place</td><td width=246>El Salvador</td></tr><tr><td width=139>Nationality</td><td width=246>American</td></tr><tr><td width=139>Education</td><td width=246>University of California</td></tr><tr><td width=139>Profession</td><td width=246>Realtor, Model</td></tr><tr><td width=139>Relationship Status</td><td width=246>In Relationship</td></tr><tr><td width=139>Partner</td><td width=246>JaVale McGee</td></tr><tr><td width=139>Kids</td><td width=246>1 (Genevieve Grey McGee)</td></tr></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCgnZ5jsLC5jqOYr5mcmnqur8aenGg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jayda-cheaves-age-how-old-is-jayda-cheaves.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jayda Cheaves Age: How Old Is Jayda Cheaves?">&larr;
