This sexy Brazilian thriller, which is adapted from Sue Hecker’s critically acclaimed novel O Lado Bom de Ser Traída, skillfully combines a gripping storyline with sensual scenes.</p><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=776 data-injectable=true>Standing shoulder to shoulder with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix’s greatest steamy hits like 365 Days</a>, Burning Betrayal seems to be a classic tried-and-true blend of perilous mystery and dark romance, a formula proven to keep audiences spellbound. However, the film tries to go beyond simple titillation, in contrast to many other films of its category, in an effort to provide a story that goes beyond other erotic cinema clichés.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=606 data-current-count=906 data-injectable=true>At the heart of the narrative, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">entwining the lives of Babi, her former fiancé Caio, and the charismatic “hot judge” Marco</a>, lies a compelling mystery that propels the storyline forward. After discovering Caio’s years-long betrayal, Babi embarks on a quest for vengeance, finding the perfect opportunity with a money-laundering case surrounding Caio. Aiding her on her journey are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her two best friends, Paty and Thiago.</a> This daring pursuit also draws her closer to Judge Marco, the enigmatic figure overseeing the legal proceedings and harboring a keen interest in Babi’s every move.</p><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>As the narrative progresses, Babi learns disturbing details about her ex-fiance, delving into the depths of his deceitful life. The suspense builds with each new detail that she learns, culminating in a climax when she learns who is the mastermind behind Caio’s shadowy empire. So, who is this enigmatic figure, and what happens at the end of Burning Betrayal?</p><h2 id=h-burning-betrayal-s-ending-explained data-injectable=false>Burning Betrayal’s ending, explained</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=666 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true>The narrative picks up its true pace after Babi and Marco get acquainted, and Babi begins to consider a future with him. This is when the first twist kicks in, revealing that Marco is actually married to a woman named Paula, and even has a daughter. Paula enters Marco’s house where he and Babi are asleep, and Babi quickly leaves after being startled to see her. However, a strange car strikes her while she is riding her motorcycle home.</p><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>After surviving the accident, Babi is certain it wasn’t an accident, and that the vehicle hit her on purpose. This thought was fueled by her previous finding of a video of herself and Marco from their road trip on her laptop, which was meant to threaten her. Suspecting Caio to be behind it all because of her resolution to expose his money laundering scam, she asks her best friend Thiago to file a complaint against Caio the next day.</p><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>The biggest twist, though, occurs shortly after Thiago arrives to pick Babi up, under the guise of going to Marco with him to file a lawsuit against Caio. The movie puts the last pieces of the puzzle together when Thiago takes Babi to a remote forest instead of driving to Marco’s residence. The man who appeared to be a good friend to Babi all along turns out to be the main villain and the mastermind behind all the sinister happenings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/burning-betrayal.jpg><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=687 data-injectable=true>Thiago is revealed to be working with Caio the whole time on his illegal businesses. He was the one who spied on Babi, sent her videos of her and Marco getting intimate, and hit her motorcycle the in order to scare her away from pursuing her investigation of Caio’s money-laundering scam. But since Babi was still dead set on exposing Caio, Thiago decided that he had to kill Babi.</p><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=471 data-injectable=true>Luckily, things don’t turn out the way he had intended. After learning of his plan, Marco leaves for the forest in an attempt to save Babi. Thiago and Marco get into a physical altercation towards the end, and Thiago shoots Caio during this last battle, causing him to die on the spot. Thiago also manages to shoot Marco in the side. But before Thiago can murder Babi, policemen that Marco had notified arrive at the scene and shoot Thiago in the back, killing him.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Do Babi and Marco end up together at the end?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Burning-Betrayal-1.jpg><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=679 data-injectable=true>Despite initially believing that Marco had betrayed her just like her ex-fiance did, things soon tone down between Marco and Babi. Marco comes clean to her, and reveals that he is on the verge of getting a divorce from Paula, who has been struggling with mental health issues, and even once endangered their daughter, who is being taken care of in hospital due to a rare disease.</p><p data-characters=534 data-current-count=534 data-injectable=false>Babi realizes that Marco genuinely loves her after he saves her from Thiago in the end, and as soon as she is free, she runs to him. She was confident that this time, she had discovered a man who could keep her happy, fulfill all her desires, and would never betray her. The duo does end up together as six months later, we see them living their best life. Marco’s daughter is now discharged from the hospital and is getting better.
