As always, the featured performers seem to get more electrifying, spectacular, and positively emotional season by season. In fact, season 18 was so awesome, that the <a href=#>golden buzzer</a> rang during the season’s first episode.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=183 data-current-count=183 data-injectable=false>Since then, there have been more amazing moments from various performing acts that’ll keep even the most casual fan of the show talking long after the spectacular season finale.</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true>Through all the excitement of this past season, the mesmerizing dog tricks act Adrian Stoica and <a href=#>Hurricane</a> were named the winners. In second place was magician Anna DeGuzman, followed by the dance group Murmuration placing third.</p><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=385 data-injectable=false>But aside from the acts that perform on the show, there are the judges. We all know <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Simon Cowell</a>. Joining him are actress <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sofia Vergara</a>, TV host <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Heidi Klum</a>, and comedian <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Howie Mandel</a>. This group of people with different entertainment backgrounds helps determine who passes through the audition and makes it to the live performance rounds. But how much do these people make on the show?</p><h2 id=h-how-much-do-the-judges-make-on-america-s-got-talent data-injectable=false>How much do the judges make on America’s Got Talent?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=685 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>It was reported numerous times that the judges for&nbsp;America’s Got Talent&nbsp;have different paychecks during their time on the show, and it makes sense since the judges tend to change after a few seasons. For example, Cowell only joined&nbsp;America’s Got Talent&nbsp;in season 11. Meanwhile, Mandel has been on the show since season 5 and Vergara is the newest judge in season 18’s lineup since she first appeared in season 15.</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=182 data-injectable=false>The judges of America’s Got Talent season 18 earn a salary starting from $70,000 per episode, with reports that one judge in particular may be the wealthiest judge on the show.</p><h3 id=h-how-much-does-simon-cowell-take-home-for-being-an-agt-judge data-injectable=false>How much does Simon Cowell take home for being an AGT judge?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-06-234113.png><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=226 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hello Magazine</a>&nbsp;reported that Cowell earned around $95 million for his appearance in America’s Got Talent in 2022. And there is a chance that it could have increased in 2023, but that hasn’t been confirmed yet.</p><p data-characters=486 data-current-count=712 data-injectable=true>The Sony Music executive has been used to the big bucks for what seems like forever though, especially back when he was one of the original judges and producers of the legendary reality singing competition, <a href=#>American Idol</a>. In addition to that success, he was the creator of The X Factor, another reality TV competition that laid the foundation for what fans know and love from America’s Got Talent. That track record certainly would equal eight, or even nine-figure paydays by now.</p><h3 id=h-sofia-vergara-gets-paid-how-much-for-being-a-judge-on-agt data-injectable=false>Sofia Vergara gets paid how much for being a judge on AGT?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-06-233902.png><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=504 data-injectable=true>Sofia Vergara, the former&nbsp;<a href=#>Modern Family</a>&nbsp;actress earned $10 million per season, as originally reported by Forbes back in 2020. However, during her time on Modern Family, she was paid per episode.</p><p data-characters=511 data-current-count=511 data-injectable=true>According to <a href=#>Parade</a>, reports had Vergara collecting at least a half-million per episode of Modern Family by the time the show ended, making her the highest-paid actress on television for a while. That was a huge jump from when she started the series making a “measly” $30,000 to $65,000 per episode, and rightly so since that sitcom grew to become a mega-hit by the series finale. With what she made working on Modern Family, she’s arguably worth the same (if not more) as a current AGT judge.</p><h3 id=h-what-does-heidi-klum-get-paid-to-be-an-agt-judge data-injectable=false>What does Heidi Klum get paid to be an AGT judge?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-06-233658.png><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true>Following Vergara is supermodel and actress <a href=#>Heidi Klum</a>, who has been a part of the show since season eight, but took a break in season 14 and parts of season 15.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Soaps.com</a>&nbsp;reported that Klum earned around $100,000 per episode, giving her a total of $2.5 to 3 million per season.</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>Like Cowell, she’s got longevity on America’s Got Talent but also has been involved with other successful reality shows of her own, such as hosting and enjoying her role as executive producer of <a href=#>Project Runway</a>. Oh, and she’s also making bank by hosting Germany’s Next Top Model.</p><h3 id=h-and-how-about-howie-mandel-s-salary-judging-agt data-injectable=false>And how about Howie Mandel’s salary judging AGT?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-06-233441.png><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=230 data-injectable=false>Finally, there is the ever-popular Howie Mandel, who’s no stranger to hosting or judging a show. He’s been on AGT for quite some time now, taking one of the judges’ seats ever since his season-five debut in 2010.</p><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>&nbsp;reported in 2023 that this long-time America’s Got Talent judge and former<a href=#> Deal or No Deal</a> host earns around $70,000 per episode, making him the lowest-earning judge on the show. That might not be such a big deal though since he co-hosts the Howie Mandel Does Stuff Podcast with his daughter, Jackelyn Shultz as well as a recent stint as host of the Netflix gameshow Bullsh*t the Game Show.</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>The judges of&nbsp;America’s Got Talent&nbsp;earn a pretty high salary just for, well, judging. But they’re what helps make the show interesting as they decide who makes it through to the next round. While the differing salaries for each judge is certainly an interesting factoid, Mandel still being in the show to this day shows that he’s happy with his current paycheck.</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=606 data-injectable=false>Season 18 of&nbsp;America’s Got Talent&nbsp;ended with the great news that a 19th season is on the horizon, set to air during the summer of 2024. The full cast from the previous seasons are also rumored to make return appearances.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypu9ZmpK6bmGKxsHnToZxmoqWZtKa%2FjKaYpJ1dpLturcyeqaKbkah6qLvTZquapJWjwXA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-there-a-demon-slayer-season-5-release-date.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is there a Demon Slayer season 5 release date?">&larr;
