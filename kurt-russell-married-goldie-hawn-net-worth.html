Even though the couple is in a long-term relationship, they aren't married.</span></p><p><span>In the 2007&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>interview with Woman'sDay</a>, Kurt's girlfriend Goldie explained why they aren't married. The American actress explained:</span></p><p><strong><span>"We have done just perfectly without marrying. I already feel devoted, and isn't that what marriage is supposed to do? So as long as my emotional state is in a state of devotion, honesty, caring, and loving, then we're fine. We have raised our children brilliantly; they are beautiful people. We did a great job there and we didn't have to get married to do that. I like waking up every day and seeing that he is there and knowing that I have a choice. There is really no reason to marry."</span></strong></p><p><span>Likewise, Kurt echoed the same sentiment in his 2017 <a href=# rel=noopener>interview with&nbsp;Extra</a>:</span></p><p><strong><span>"Look, I’ve said this for 34 years, I don’t think Goldie and I, in real terms, are any different than any other couple; we go through all the same things. But the important thing of who the two people are in a relationship is what you have to deal with. There’s going to be ups and downs and sideways and everything else. I just think after 34 years, you’re going to have experienced every emotion that you can together."</span></strong></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/celebs/kurt-russell-and-goldie-hawn.jpeg alt="Kurt Russell And Goldie Hawn" width=650 height=433 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span><strong>Kurt Russell and his girlfriend Goldie Hawn attending the world premiere of 'Guardians Of The Galaxy 2' in&nbsp;Hollywood, California in 2017 (©:&nbsp;Barry King/Getty Images)</strong></span></p><p><span>Talking about their romantic encounter, Russell and Hawn first met in the Disney movie&nbsp;The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band in 1966.
