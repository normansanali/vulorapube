He has appeared in a recurrent role in ‘American Dreams,’ ‘Scandal,’ ‘Switched at Birth,’ and ‘Gossip Girl,’ among other shows. The Brotherhood, Prison of the Dead, and Micro Mini-kids are among his best performances. He appeared in the ‘Yes We Can’ video to support Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, in addition to movies and television shows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cassidy-Boesch-with-her-husband.jpg><p>Page is a multi-talented individual who, in addition to acting, has participated in sports. During his time at Whitefish Bay High School, he was a captain of the football and baseball teams. He has a fascination with the natural world since he was a child, which led him to earn a bachelor’s degree in ecology and evolutionary biology from Princeton University in 1998. He knew he wanted to be an actor after college, so he changed his career path to become a Hollywood actor.</p><h2>After falling in love at first sight, getting married</h2><p>She met her partner at a friend’s cocktail party, which both of them had planned to skip at first. Fortunately, they were both able to attend the celebration and meet each other. Page was the one who first saw her in the door and fell in love with her at first sight. They spent the entire party talking to one other and then drove her home when her friend requested it. She happened to live in the same area as Page, which was surprising. The couple stayed in touch after falling in love at first sight and later married.</p><h2 id=Before_meeting_her_marriage_was_not_important_to_her_husband&nbsp;>Before meeting her, marriage was not important to her husband</h2><p>Her husband did not feel that marriage could be a thing for him or that it was significant to his life until they met. He accepted to have a companion for the rest of his life, but he refused to accept the legal aspects that came with it. However, things changed for her spouse after meeting her. She had a big impression on him, and he understood she was a good deal for him. He had even promised his pals that he would remain single for the full summer season before meeting her. However, after he saw her, he couldn’t help but breach the pledge.</p><h2>A wedding ceremony from a fairytale</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cassidy-Boesch-with-her-husband-1.jpg><p>The pair ultimately tied the knot in front of their family and friends on November 14, 2014. A spectacular fantasy wedding ceremony was held in a mansion outside of Santa Barbara, California. Some of Page’s celebrity co-workers, such as Jonathan Bennett, who co-starred with him in “Mean Girl” and competed on “Dancing with the Stars,” also attended the wedding and served as Groomsmen.</p><h2 id=Blessed_with_three_children>Blessed with three children</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cassidy-Boeschs-kids.-1605276183.jpg><p>She is the mother of three children.
