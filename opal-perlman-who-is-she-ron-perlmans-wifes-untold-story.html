Her mother is a dressmaker, and her love of fashion led her to the United States.</p><p>Opal Stone’s mother worked as a seamstress in her village. Growing up with rich tropical beauty, Stone quickly fell in love with fashion, which led her to the United States. She attended Parsons School of Design in New York City after coming to the United States.</p><p>Perlman gradually had a deep interest in American fashion and even worked as a couturier in Los Angeles, California.</p><h2><span id=Her_Professional_Jewelry_Designer_Career>Her Professional Jewelry Designer Career</span></h2><p>Opal Stone has developed a highly successful route as a jewelry designer via unwavering dedication and selection of he greatest materials for designs.</p><p>Opal Stone Fine Jewelry is currently her business.
