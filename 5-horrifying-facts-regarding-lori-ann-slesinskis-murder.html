The terrifying case of Slesinski will be revisited and examined in the forthcoming edition of CBS’ 48 Hours, which will air on Saturday, September 24, 2022, at 10 p.m. / 9 p.m. EST, exclusively on CBS. The episode is named A Man With a Past, and the official CBS summary is as follows:</p><p>“A young lady departs. The main suspect has a criminal history, having killed his parents as a youngster. Did he commit another murder? Saturday, 48 Hours journalist Peter Van Sant reports.”</p><p>Viewers have been eager to hear more about the cold case since CBS released the official sneak peek trailer for the 48 Hours program titled, A Man With a Past.</p><h2>Learn five important facts regarding the tragic disappearance and murder of Lori Ann Slesinski.</h2><h2>Who was Lori Ann Slesinski?</h2><p>Lori Ann Slesinski was a lady who was born in Auburn, Alabama. Arlene and Casey Slesinski gave birth to her. She had a brother called Paul and a puppy named Peanut that she adored.&nbsp;She graduated from Auburn University in 2004. She aspired to get a Master of Psychology. She reportedly worked at a nearby mental health hospital with her friend Lindsay Braun, whom she met at Auburn University during her junior year. Lori Ann, who was 24 years old in 2006, had a bright future ahead of her. Her whole existence, however, was flipped upside down when she vanished on Saturday, June 10, 2006, leaving no trace.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Lori-Ann-Slesinski-1.jpg alt="Lori Ann Slesinski" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Where was Lori Ann last seen?</h2><p>Lori Ann’s closest friend Lindsay Braun said she planned to visit Braun’s house for a ladies night out on June 10, 2006. She was last seen that evening at a nearby Walmart, picking up items for her Braun’s house. Braun told 48 Hours’ Van Sant about Lori Ann’s disappearance on the night she went missing:</p><p>“We were planning on having cocktails at my place,… We were going to drink Rum Runners, watch a movie, and just hang out and enjoy some lady time. She phoned at 6:30 a.m. and said, “I’m going to swing by the store, pick up the drink mixes, and then I’ll be heading to your place,” The phone then rang around 30 minutes later. It rang a few times. I replied that no one was present.”</p><h2>Who exactly is Derrill Ennis?</h2><p>Derrill Ennis, originally from Auburn, Alabama, was arrested and convicted in 2018 for the abduction and cold-blooded murder of Lori Ann Slesinski. He was 38 years old when he was arrested.</p><p>He used to be acquainted with Lori Ann, according to sources. According to Braun, Derrill was with Lori on the day of her disappearance because she heard his voice in the background when speaking on the phone with her. She was unconcerned, though, since Derrill and Lori were friends.</p><p>Braun stated:</p><p>“I wasn’t worried since they were pals.”</p><p></p><h2>What occurred after Lori Ann vanished?</h2><p>Lori Ann Slesinski’s relatives and friends realized something was awry when she failed to answer her phone many times. When one of her coworkers and her closest friend went to check on her, they discovered her house door open and her beloved dog alone.</p><p>Lori’s relatives reported her missing on June 13, 2006. Lori’s disappearance was first classified as a missing person investigation by the Alabama Police Department. Her automobile, however, detonated four days later in a cul-de-sac outside a construction site. Lori, on the other hand, was nowhere to be seen.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Lori-Ann-Slesinski-2.jpg alt="Lori Ann Slesinski" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>What Happen to Derrill Ennis?</h2><p>For more than a decade, the case remained unsolved. However, the case was revived in 2016, and following an 18-month investigation, investigators discovered enough evidence to prove Derrill Ennis’ participation in the crime.</p><p>Ennis was apprehended by officials in rural Virginia on August 2018. Lori Ann Slesinski’s gruesome murder was brought against him. He was arrested and lodged in the Montgomery County Virginia Jail without bail. He is expected to stand trial for murder in March 2022.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>CBS</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Lori Ann Slesinski</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGhsZqCfp7%2BqstiipaBllpawtb%2BMq5ygmaKZtq%2BzjKWmq6FdlruvedKlnKyhnqi4qr%2BMpqyrnJWnfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-anthony-quinn-warner-nashville-bomber-4292165.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anthony Quinn Warner: 5 Things About Nashville Bomber Who Died In Christmas Day RV Explosion">&larr;
