This time, it’s someone who is related to one of the game’s best designs, Jhin, the psychopathic artist and killer. In a previous <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a>, I made a guess regarding their potential ties, and the new<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> trailer</a> just proves it right.</p><p>The trailer for Hwei came right after the 1st<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> final</a> game ended between T1 and WBG. And I gotta say, this is instantly one of my favorite Champions trailers in a while.</p><p>After <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Naafiri </a>and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Briar</a>, who in their own right were incredible designs, Hwei might just take the spotlight. In this article, I shall talk about the details of his trailer and also his abilities and lore.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#><span>League of Legends Worlds 2024 Will Take Place In London</span></a></p><h2 id=hwei-first-looks class="rb-heading-index-0 wp-block-heading">Hwei First looks</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gameriv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-93.png><p>This is the first look of Hwei in the game client. As you can see, he kind of has that Aphelios energy. At the same time, his artistic spirit resembles Jhin to some extent, albeit in a different manner.</p><h3 id=hwei-splash-art class="rb-heading-index-1 wp-block-heading">Hwei Splash Art</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gameriv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-94-1200x675.png><p>This is the official Hwei Splash Art. Here, we see the colors coming out of his paintbrush. The color mix here is also seen in his ability combos, as I will discuss further later.</p><h2 id=hwei8217s-first-impressions-from-the-trailer class="rb-heading-index-2 wp-block-heading">Hwei’s First Impressions from the Trailer</h2><p>Right off the bat, we listen to Hwei’s gloomy yet calm voice as he talks about the dark clinging to him. He also refers to Jhin bringing his artistic talents to light, potentially signaling strong ties with him in terms of narrative.</p><p>Hwei also talks about the moral ambiguity he faces, mentioning the line between right and wrong blurring. Although he acknowledges the light is still inside him, he doesn’t want to let go of it. This is quite in contrast to the Maestro, Jhin, who lives in darkness and makes art out of it.</p><p>Hwei’s lore being weaved together with Jhin is a great news for the League of Legends story enthusiast.</p><p>In the trailer, Hwei showcases his vibrant and majestically colorful abilities. His primary weapon is a paintbrush (How surprising!), and all of his abilities splatter a mixture of all kinds of colors. The rift is just his canvas for him to splash pain on.</p><h2 id=hwei-abilities-revealed class="rb-heading-index-3 wp-block-heading">Hwei Abilities Revealed</h2><p>Thanks to SkinSpotlights, we have Hwei’s abilities description. Although his abilities are kind of unique, akin to Aphelios’, but perhaps twice as complex. <strong>Apparently, Hwei can mix each of his abilities with each other. For example, instead of having a regular Q, he can mix it with his ultimate. </strong>Here’s a rundown of all of his abilities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gameriv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Hwei-Abilities-1200x675.jpg><h3 id=passive-signature-of-the-visionary class="rb-heading-index-4 wp-block-heading">Passive: Signature of the Visionary</h3><p>Hwei’s damaging abilities against enemy champions mark them for a few seconds.</p><p>Hitting marked enemies with another damaging ability creates an explosion underneath them, detonating after a short delay and dealing magic damage to all enemies in range</p><h3 id=qrwrew-wash-brush class="rb-heading-index-5 wp-block-heading">QR/WR/EW- Wash Brush</h3><p>Hwei clears his paintbrush and returns to base abilities without using mana or cooldowns</p><p>Hwei has 10 spells. QWE actually serves more as a spellbook than traditional abilities.</p><p>Q signifies damage, W utility, and E for control, giving Hwei the full package of a mage.</p><h3 id=qq-devastating-fire class="rb-heading-index-6 wp-block-heading">QQ- Devastating Fire</h3><p>Hwei paints a blazing fireball that flies out in the target direction.</p><p>It explodes on the first enemy hit or at maximum range, dealing magic damage plus percent max health magic damage to all enemies in an area.</p><h3 id=qw-severing-bolt class="rb-heading-index-7 wp-block-heading">QW- Severing Bolt</h3><p>Hwei paints a long-range, devastating bolt at the target location. After a delay, the bolt strikes, dealing magic damage.</p><p>Immobilized or isolated enemies take increased damage based on missing health.</p><h3 id=qe-molten-fissure class="rb-heading-index-8 wp-block-heading">QE- Molten Fissure</h3><p>Hwei paints a field of exploding volcanic eruptions, creating lingering lava in its path.</p><p>Every eruption deals magic damage to enemies hit. Enemies in the lava area are dealt magic damage per second and are slowed.</p><h3 id=wq-fleeting-current class="rb-heading-index-9 wp-block-heading">WQ – Fleeting Current</h3><p>Hwei paints a current of swift waters in a line for a few seconds that grants movement speed to himself and his allies.</p><h3 id=ww-pool-of-reflection class="rb-heading-index-10 wp-block-heading">WW – Pool of Reflection</h3><p>Hwei forms a protective pool at the target location that lasts for a few seconds. Allied champions inside the area gain an immediate shield, increasing in value over a few seconds while in the area.</p><h3 id=we-stirring-lights class="rb-heading-index-11 wp-block-heading">WE – Stirring Lights</h3><p>Hwei paints three swirling lights that circle him for several seconds.</p><p>Hwei’s next 3 attacks or spells deal bonus magic damage and grant mana on hit.</p><h3 id=eq-grim-visage class="rb-heading-index-12 wp-block-heading">EQ – Grim Visage</h3><p>Hwei launches a terrifying face that strikes the first enemy hit, dealing magic damage and causing them to flee for a brief duration.</p><h3 id=ew-gaze-of-the-abyss class="rb-heading-index-13 wp-block-heading">EW – Gaze of the Abyss</h3><p>Hwei paints an abyssal eye at the target location that grants vision and locks onto the nearest visible enemy champion.</p><p>After a short delay, the eye fires at the locked-on champion, rooting the first enemy in its path for a few seconds and dealing magic damage to them.</p><h3 id=ee-crushing-maw class="rb-heading-index-14 wp-block-heading">EE – Crushing Maw</h3><p>Hwei paints crushing jaws that deal magic damage to enemies hit and pulls them toward the center, slowing them by a set amount that quickly decays.</p><h3 id=r-spiraling-despair class="rb-heading-index-15 wp-block-heading"><strong>R – Spiraling Despair</strong></h3><p>Hwei launches a vision of pure despair that sticks to an enemy champion for a few seconds. The vision expands and overwhelms all enemies it touches, dealing magic damage per second. Enemies within the zone are afflicted with stacks of Despair over time. Each stack of Despair applies a stacking percent slow. Upon completion, the vision shatters, dealing magic damage.</p><h2 id=hwei-release-date class="rb-heading-index-16 wp-block-heading">Hwei Release Date</h2><p>Hwei is going to get his first release on PBE on November 20, 2023, followed by his official release on live servers on patch <strong>13.24.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifkaKys7XVZ5qopV%2Bjsrh5wqGYpqiZpLtutNaeoGaklZa0trGMqJ1mpJWcsq%2Bw0mg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./braunwyn-windham-burke-pics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pics Of The RHOC Star  Hollywood Life">&larr;
