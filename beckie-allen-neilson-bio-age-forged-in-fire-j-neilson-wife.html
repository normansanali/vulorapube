J. Neilson is one of those judges whom you can see slashing things around. But how much do you know about his personal life; especially his wife, Beckie Allen-Neilson?</span></p><p><span>Well, this “Beckie Allen-Neilson Bio” is all about her.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Meet Beckie Allen-Neilson, Forged In Fire J. Neilson Wife</b></h3><p><span>Beckie Allen-Neilson first met J. Neilson on a dating site in 2009. According to&nbsp; J. Neilson, he initially sent Beckie a drawing of himself by Baxter Clyde Burt to “try and whoo” her. But though his plan worked, Beckie seemed to have only agreed to go out with him because she was curious about what was wrong with his eye.</span></p><p><span>The two then went on exchanged vows on February 3, 2013, after 4 years of sharing the dating bliss.</span></p><p><span>On their 8th wedding anniversary, Beckie took it to her IG to share, “I was lucky enough to trap this prize into marrying me & on this 3rd, it’ll have been 8 years married… she’s also the cutest camera person I know… no offense FIF crew.”</span></p><p><span>Likewise, commemorating their 10 years of togetherness in 2019, J. Neilson let the world know that Beckie is her “perfect match.”</span></p><p><span>During their journey of over a decade, the husband-wife have been through multiple ups and downs, but have always stuck by each other’s side. Their daughter Shanon turned 14 in 2022 and is already making her own weapon designs like her older brother.</span></p><p><span>In the summer of 2018, Beckie made her first piece with a 2084 blade, a Hamon & Paracord handle, a Kydex sheath, and a matching cord. The knife was sold for $50 on their website.</span></p><h3><b>Beckie Allen-Neilson Age</b></h3><p><span>Beckie Allen-Neilson was repotdlty born in 1970. So, that would make her 52 years of age in 2022; she is a year younger than her husband J. Neilson.</span></p><p><span>She receives her birthday wishes on March 1 and is of the Pisces zodiac.</span></p><p><span>On her 2019 birthday, J. Neilson took it to his Fb to share a beautiful pic of them captioned, “I’m a lucky guy to have spent the last 10 years with a woman that is my perfect match, happy birthday Beckie!”</span></p><h3><b>Beckie Allen-Neilson Job</b></h3><p><span>Beckie Allen-Neilson is a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA) specialist based in Sayre, Pennsylvania. She received her R.N. degree with honors in 2008 and has over 14 years of diverse experience; especially in CRNA.</span></p><p><span>As of 2022, Beckie was working as a CRNA at</span><i><span> Guthrie Robert Packer Hospital</span></i><span> at 1 Guthrie Sq, Sayre. Also, she cooperated with many other doctors and specialists at the time, without joining any medical groups.</span></p><p><span>For those of you interested, a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist job in Pennsylvania paid around $198 thousand per annum. No wonder, she was able to afford a beautiful property worth over $228 thousand at 187 Cistern LN, Towanda, PA.</span></p><p><span>Reportedly, her 3 bedrooms, 4 baths house thousand standing in a lot size of 16.88 acres was built in 2004.</span></p><p><span>Likewise, her husband J. Neilson was earning a pretty handsome salary as well. Outside his time as a judge on </span><i><span>Forged in Fire</span></i><span>, he put his craft to the test in his forge </span><i><span>Neilson’s Mountain Hollow</span></i><span>. His crafts specialized in custom high-carbon and Damascus steel blades of all sizes and lengths, as well as handmade handles and sheaths.</span></p><p><span>With over 20 years of experience in knife making, J. Neilson is one of the all-around bladesmiths in the world. In 2008, he was even given the rank of Mastersmith by the </span><i><span>American Bladesmith Society</span></i><span> — a title held by less than 115 people worldwide.</span></p><p><span>The last we checked, J. Neilson worked from his “shop in the woods” in the endless mountains of northeastern Pennsylvania.</span></p><p><span>Making blades is more than just a hobby to him. J. Neilson puts a great deal of effort into his wares, and he takes considerable pride in the finished products he produces. That’s why his knives are so expensive.</span></p><h3><b>Is Beckie Allen-Neilson On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span>Yes, as of April 2022, find Beckie Allen-Neilson on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>welderranchhand8248</span></a><span> with 15 followers.
