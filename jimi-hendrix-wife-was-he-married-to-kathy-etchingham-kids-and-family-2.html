In the early parts of their relationship, they lived with Jimi’s manager and his girlfriend in Montagu Square.</p><p>However, they were forced to move owing to the racial prejudices of the time and the “rock-and-roll lifestyle” that people tended to frown upon.</p><p>The couple, alongside their previous flatmates, then moved to Berkeley Square. This living arrangement was short-lived, and they finally moved to 23 Brook Street in Mayfair.</p><p><strong>Also Read: </strong>Meet Ed Sheeran Two Kids With His Wife Cherry Seaborn, Family And Ethnicity</p><p>This place of their dwelling now functions as a museum.</p><p>The two continued to live there until they broke up.

His mother is Eva Sundquist.&nbsp;</p><p>Hendrix allegedly has other children, but James is legally the only one to be declared his son. He takes after his father and plays the guitar.&nbsp;</p><p>Though his father was aware of him, the two could not meet. Jimi had promised to meet him when he returned to Stockholm for a performance but was unable to do so.</p><p>Jimi made further promises but died only a month after his Stockholm performance.</p><p>After his father’s death, his grandfather, i.e., Jimi Hendrix’s father, James Allen Hendrix, “Al,” took possession of the world-famous musician’s entire wealth.</p><p>In light of this, the younger James sued his grandfather for leaving him out of his father’s inheritance.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong>Where Are Stephen Sondheim Kids?
