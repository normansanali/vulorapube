Even though she was a child actress, her parents, Gloria and Frank von Öy, still believed in the importance of formal education.&nbsp;They enrolled her in Newton High School.</span></p><p><span>While still in high school, Jenna made her television debut on an episode of ABC’s Weekend Special in 1986. Her satisfying performances landed her new roles on&nbsp;</span><span>Tales from Darkside</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Kate and Allie</span><span>.&nbsp;She then starred in a short-lived series,&nbsp;</span><span>Lenny</span><span>&nbsp;which ran from 1990 to 1991.</span></p><p><span>The starlet nurtured her acting career while attending high school, so when she finally graduated, she didn’t head to college immediately.&nbsp;Instead, she starred on&nbsp;</span><span>Fleur</span><span>&nbsp;1990-1995, playing the role of Six Lemeure, a fast-talking character.&nbsp;When the show ended, Jennifer went to the University of Southern California, where she attended film school to further her acting skills.</span></p><p><span>Although she attended college as a semi-famous personality, Jenna was committed to a full college experience, participating in traditional college activities such as sorority membership.&nbsp;She was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta for her two-year stint in college.&nbsp;Although she was supposed to attend college for four years, she dropped out after her second year to pursue her acting career.</span></p><p><span>Jenna Von Oy returned to the camera in 1996 in a TV movie&nbsp;</span><span>She Wept</span><span>&nbsp;No.&nbsp;Her second starring role came in 1999 when she was cast as Stevie van Lowe in&nbsp;</span><span>The Parkers,</span><span>&nbsp;a well-received show that aired from 1999 to 2004. While the show was running, Jenna lent her voice to the animated show.&nbsp;</span><span>Poivre ann</span><span>, bringing the character to life, Bibelot St Blaire.</span></p><p><span>During the 90s to the early 2000s, Van Oy was an active and highly sought-after actress.&nbsp;Immediately after The Parkers ended, she got a role in the 2005 film&nbsp;</span><span>Marsha Potter Gets a Life</span><span>.&nbsp;She also appeared in&nbsp;</span><span>Case Closed</span><span>&nbsp;and in&nbsp;</span><span>Family Guy,</span><span>&nbsp;episode ‘Perfect Castaway.’</span></p><p><span>The majority of Jenna’s screen appearances have been on TV, one of the few feature films she appeared in was&nbsp;</span><span>Born on the 4th of July</span><span>&nbsp;starring alongside Tom Cruise.&nbsp;She also starred in the animated film,&nbsp;</span><span>A Clumsy Movie</span><span>, providing the voice of Stacey.&nbsp;The budding actress then played Grace in a direct-to-DVD feature of&nbsp;</span><span>Dr. Dolittle 3</span><span>&nbsp;which was released in 2006.</span></p><p><span>Outside of acting, she tried to start a music career, especially in the country music genre.&nbsp;She recorded a demo track and although she hasn’t had a breakout hit since her journey began in 2000, she persisted.&nbsp;She released her debut album titled&nbsp;</span><span>Breathing Room</span><span>&nbsp;in 2007.</span></p><p><span>So far in her professional career since 1986, Jenna has appeared in 28 TV shows and 3 feature films.&nbsp;Her work in the shows&nbsp;</span><span>Fleur</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Lenny</span><span>&nbsp;Elle earned four nominations during her career, including two.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jenna Von Oy enjoys her moderate success playing with her family.&nbsp;Numerous TV appearances in the 90s to early 2000s helped her build a current net worth of $2 million.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Who is her husband?</span></strong></h2><p><span>It may have been a while since Jenny Von Oy graced the big screens as often as she did in the 90s. According to some sources, she has taken a step back from acting and the spotlight in general and was married to Brad Butcher, a computer data consultant.&nbsp;The duo married in 2010 in Newtown, Connecticut.</span></p><p><span>Since their marriage, they have been happily together and raised their two daughters, Gray and Marlowe, born in 2012 and 2014, respectively.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Where is Jenna Von Oy now?</span></strong></h2><p><span>As previously mentioned, Jenna left Hollywood and retired to the comfort of a simple life in Nashville in what was supposed to be a break but never ended.&nbsp;Since stepping away from the crazy world of Hollywood, she’s published two books on parenting and is taking care of her family pretty well while trying a few other things.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiilaO7onnVqKVmp6lirqixjKGsrJqRo7FuusStZLCnoqm1bsPHnqmeZZmoerS0xGalqK9f</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kaiju-no-8-release-date-opening-song-closing-streaming-crunchyroll.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kaiju No. 8 gets an opening song preview, comes to Crunchyroll in April">&larr;
