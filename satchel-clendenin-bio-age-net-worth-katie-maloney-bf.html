Who is he? What does he do for a living? Who are his family members?</p><p>These are some of the questions we’ll be tackling in this article here. So, keep scrolling down to learn more.</p><h3><strong>Meet Satchel Clendenin, Katie Maloney BF</strong></h3><p>In the 19 April 2023 episode, Katie Maloney took her 25-year-old beau Satchel Clendenin to Lala Kent’s birthday dinner, claiming that he was named after baseball player Satchel Paige. “Satchel is a very sweet guy that I met one night out with my girlfriends,” Katie said. “I was like, ‘Oh here’s this young guy, this will be fun.’ I didn’t really anticipate to keep hanging out with him, I came for the D and I stayed for the conversation.”</p><p>Katie and Satchel reportedly met when she was out one night with her girlfriends. She didn’t expect to keep hanging out with him after their initial meeting.</p><p>Katie initially said she kept her budding relationship with Satchel under wraps out of respect for her ex-husband, but after Schwartz decided to disregard Katie’s request to avoid dating anyone in their common buddy group, everything changed. Even in a confessional, she made note of the stark differences between the two guys.</p><p>“He’s very sweet and shows me affection, and it’s just a nice change,” Katie added. “And let’s just say I won’t be complaining to anyone about how his dick doesn’t work.”</p><p>The cast members of Katie have already met Satchel who had mixed reactions from different casts. Lala said that Katie was “beaming” while cozying up to Satchel, but Scheana was a bit more critical. “It’s weird seeing Katie with this mactor, shaggy dog-looking motherf*cker,” Scheana said in a confessional. “I mean, he looks like he just got groomed at Vanderpump Dogs.”</p><p>But Katie hesitated to introduce Satchel as her boyfriend. In February, Katie announced that she was “single”&nbsp;on her Instagram Story, even laughing off&nbsp;dating rumors&nbsp;with newly engaged&nbsp;Lukas Gage, and told Andy Cohen on&nbsp;Watch What Happens Live&nbsp;that she has a type while dating. “They’re all young; I like it,” Katie said. “The young ones are kind of where it’s at.”</p><p>According to&nbsp;Bravo,&nbsp;Katie had teased that she was having&nbsp;a&nbsp;“casual thing” with a younger guy in the fall of 2022. This man turned out to be Satchel. However, they are no longer together. In December 2022, Katie confirmed that she was single.</p><h3><strong>Satchel Clendenin Age</strong></h3><p>In 2023, Satchel Clendenin is 26 years old. He is 11 years younger than the 36 years old girlfriend Katie.</p><h3><strong>Satchel Clendenin Job</strong></h3><p>Satchel Clendenin is an aspiring actor who has appeared in a handful of projects including short films, music videos, and theatre productions. Some of his notable works are A Bridge Between Us, Buried,&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Sequence of Adolescent Revenge. He will also appear in the upcoming&nbsp;Remy & Arletta.</p><p>Satchel is represented by One Collective Entertainment. Per his resume, Satchel has also appeared on Eye For A Eye, “Better on Your Own” – Kristiane Alphson, “Right?” – Mccall, TAEYANG – Music Video, Volumetric Capturing Instructional Video, Troubled Waters, Connection, Almost Maine by John Cariani, Almost Maine by John Cariani, and more.</p><p>During his high school years, Satchel played hockey for Aberdeen Wings. In regular season Satchel played a total of 12 games during the 2017-2018 season.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Satchel Clendenin Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>In 2023, Satchel Clendenin’s net worth is likely under $150 thousand.</p><h3><strong>Satchel Clendenin Height</strong></h3><p>Stachel Clendenin stands tall at the height of 6 feet 1 inch.

He has blue eyes, brown hair, and long curly hair which are his distinct features.</p><h3><strong>Satchel Clendenin Family</strong></h3><p>Satchel Clendenin is the son of Celia “Lorrie” Clendenin and Bill Clendenin, both of Bethesda, Maryland. Celia is 54 years old born in December 1968. Bill turned 52 years old in June 2022.</p><p>Lorrie worked as a preschool teacher and an artist. Her creative endeavors clearly go beyond shaping ceramics on her potter’s wheel. She reshaped their home—using recycled materials and bringing an outdoor look indoors. His dad worked in sales at Crown Stairs & Rails.</p><p>During an interview, Lorrie while talking about building their house to a local newspaper, she also shared about Satchel and his siblings.&nbsp; Like Satchel who was named after Hall of Fame pitcher Satchel Paige, they also named their daughter Marley after (reggae legend Bob Marley, Lorrie’s dad loved him) and Cooper (they just liked the name).</p><p>Cooper played soccer at St. Mary’s College of Maryland and is expected to graduate in 2024. His sister Marley played soccer at Susquehanna (Class of 2022).</p><p>Satchel’s maternal grandmother Dr. Ellen Garb McDaniel died in 2013. She and her husband John McDaniel married for 47 years.
