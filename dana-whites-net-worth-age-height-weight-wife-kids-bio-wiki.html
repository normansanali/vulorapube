He ran the affairs of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, which today and his leadership, it has turned out to be a multi-billion-dollar company.</p><p>Maybe you know about Dana White very well But do you know how old and tall is he, and what is his net worth in 2021? If you do not know, We have prepared this article about details of Dana White’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life></span>Early Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ultimate Fighting Championship has been named the fastest hottest growing sport in the U.S.A all thanks to the guiding force and the man who rescued it, Dana White. He is the son of Dana White and June, who gave birth to him in 1969. Dana has a sister named Kelly, who was raised in Manchester, New England.</p><p>Dana White went to school in Hermon High School Mine and later Bishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas. That’s the place he met Frank Fertitta III and Lorenzo Fertitta. While in this area, he used to work as an aerobics instructor in various local gyms.</p><p>Irrespective of the controversial surrounding Dana White on relationship matters, the man is married to one cute lady Anne White whom they have three beautiful children.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=age-height-and-weight></span>Age, Height, and Weight<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Being born on 28 July 1969, Dana White is 51 years old as of today’s date 24th January 2021. His height is 1.8 m tall, and his weight is ‎88 kg.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span>Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dana White, in 2001, while working as a manager of Chuck Liddell and Titi Ortiz, an opportunity availed itself that would change Dana’s life forever. The company that owned UFC wanted to sell the UFC and Dana appealed to his childhood friend Lorenzo Fertitta to buy the company which he and his brother Frank agreed for $2 million and in exchange let him become the president of the company.</p><p>The company struggled a lot to make profits since the government, sponsors, and television executives deemed the sport to be too controversial, and that led to major athletic commissions refusing to sanction the sport. Their troubles didn’t end there as the sport was banned in pay per view and it nearly went dead.</p><p>However, in the face of extinction, Dana gave the sport a clean image, and he embarked on a mission to get it approved national wide. Things like strict medical examinations were introduced, kicks at the spine and back of the head were burned, and many more rules that emphasized participants’ safety were introduced. He won the battle with athletic commissions and even with Cable companies. The UFC image was completely transformed, and the MMA was elevated to the mainstream, all thanks to Dana White.</p><p>Today UFC, on average, generates around $200 million on PPV revenue and its worth over $1 billion in value.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=awards-achievements></span>Awards & Achievements<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Some of the awards Dana White has received over the years are Nevada Sportsman of the Year (2009), Wrestling Observer Newsletter Awards Promoter of the Year (2005–2013, 2015–2016), and World MMA Awards: Leading Man of the Year 2010/11/12/13/14/15 and a Patriot Award.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth-salary-of-dana-white></span>Net Worth & Salary of Dana White<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of January 2021, Dana White’s current net worth stands at $550 million. Dana made his money when the largest sale deal in professional sports history took place that’s the sale of UFC for $4 billion to WME IMG group, where he earned $360 million, which was equivalent to his stake 9% of UFC.</p><p>That was not all since he made a deal with the new management that stipulates he remains the president for five years and takes around 9% of the company profit; hence it’s estimated his net worth will be boosted by the $18 million he takes home annually.</p><p>The man transformed UFC and MMA into a multi-billion dollar company, and this is the greatest success story in the history of sports. Irrespective of his consistent use of F-word and his aggressive nature in handling matters, Dana White is undoubted one of the greatest business sports moguls.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyRo65uw8eiq56rXaOytXnWqKmtoF2WtKZ5x56goKCkYsSmtcahq2avmZuybrfInapmmpmkeri1yqJm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./emily-blunt-biography-age-height-husband-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emily Blunt Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth">&larr;
