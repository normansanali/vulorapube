Fans are talking about the court case none stop, with stories coming such <a href=#>Heard getting upset with Depp's "Winona Forever" tattoo</a>, or <a href=#>Johnny's savage comebacks</a> against Heard's lawyer. <span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Amber Heard Had Disturbing Things To Say Over Johnny Depp's 'Dior' Gig</a></span><a href=#>There is constantly new information being revealed</a> and in the following, we'll take a look at what Amber Heard had to say about Depp's friends. Her apparent words caused Depp to smirk in court. Let's take a look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-did-amber-heard-say-about-johnny-depp-s-friends>What Did Amber Heard Say About Johnny Depp's Friends?</h2><p>This time around, things are a little bit different, as Amber Heard is the one facing a lawsuit in court. According to Depp and his team, Heard's words almost destroyed Johnny Depp's professional career as he missed out on several roles and lost out on even more during that span.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Amber Heard Had To Start Her Interview Over Again After She Completely Lost Her Cool</a></span></p><p><a href=#>Johnny Depp's team issued a statement against Heard</a>, stating alongside Rolling Stone that Depp must be compensated for the damage done to his career and mental health.</p><p>“Johnny Depp is a victim of abuse. He has been since Ms. Heard made her very first false allegation in 2016, and has continued to be subject to abuse ever since, as outlined in his testimony."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Today’s cross-examination by Ms. Heard’s attorney has proven to be no exception. Mr. Rottenborn’s aggressive and, coincidentally, ‘jack-hammer’ approach toward a man who has suffered extensively over the last six years proves that the mistreatment of Johnny goes well beyond Ms. Heard’s grievous behavior. Colorful texts, which Johnny has already apologized for, do not equate to physical actions and Mr. Rottenborn still has not been able to connect the two, nor will he ever be able to.”</p><p>Fans are all over the case, with revealing information about the two coming out, including how Heard really felt about Johnny's friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amber-heard-did-not-enjoy-spending-time-with-depp-s-entourage>Amber Heard Did Not Enjoy Spending Time With Depp's Entourage</h2><p>There is a lot of information exposed about Depp and Heard's personal lives. In fact, Depp's sister told a story about Heard and how she called Johnny an "old, fat man," when he revealed that Dior was interested in working with him.</p><p>It seems like the abuse continued when this piece of information was revealed in the courtroom. It was said that Heard had no interest in spending time with Depp's entourage, given this reason.</p><p>"She told me she didn't like hanging around at his house with his friends because it was boring and it was all old men playing guitars and it wasn't interesting her."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Johnny Depp Reveals Why His Daughter Skipped His Wedding To Amber Heard</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Depp's reaction is really what makes the statement that much greater, as he smirks following the reveal. In the eyes of the fans at least, this is what's making Depp's case that much stronger, is how laid back and open he has been - unlike Heard who seems to be very intense and emotional throughout the case.</p><p>Fans clearly have chosen a side, and they aren't shying away from what they feel is the truth in their opinion in regard to the case.</p><h2 id=what-did-the-fans-think-of-the-moment>What Did The Fans Think Of The Moment?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans are responding to the moment with lots of sarcasm. According to the comments section from the short YouTube video, most fans are stating that Heard knew exactly what she was getting herself into prior to the relationship.</p><p>"Translation: I wasn't the center of attention," is the most liked comment from the clip.</p><p>"Marry an older man -> Complain about how he and his friends are old... okay."</p><p>"Hanging with Leo, Tobey, Tom, Robert and Brad Pitt sounds fun to me."</p><p>"He knows how ludicrous and insane that sounds. Heard didn't like seeing Johnny happy and in his environment, jamming and drinking with rockstars, having fun, because it was an environment she had no power to hurt or gaslight him."</p><p>Another fan would reveal would Depp was thinking when the statement was issued, "Depp's inner thought: "Yup, sounds like something she would say."</p><p>"He’s laughing at the irony of her calling him boring and uninteresting."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Young ppl forget they have an expiration date as well."</p><p>As the trial continues on, certainly we'll get more memorable moments, quotes and fan reactions.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Ireland Baldwin Brands Amber Heard A 'Disaster' As Case Against Johnny Depp Crumbles</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdlrqjsdFmn56Zopl6pK3LpZydZZqkta%2B62GabnqigqHqnvsiepZ2rXaS5pXnAp5tmmp%2Bntq%2Bzjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jake-weisler-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jake Weisler Net Worth">&larr;
