In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Comics</a>, Kang has a number of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">odd variants</a>, including a teenager who comes to the past from the 31st century to prevent his future domination.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=541 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=true>Kang was born Nathaniel Richards, a distant descendant of Reed Richards and Sue Storm of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fantastic Four</a>. After suffering from constant bullying at school, Nathaniel is visited by his future self who takes him on a journey throughout time, showing him how he will one day rule and conquer everything. Appalled by his future actions, Nathaniel uses the time travel suit Kang gave him to arrive at the present day in hopes of getting help from the Avengers and preventing his future incarnation from causing chaos throughout the timestream.</p><p data-characters=523 data-current-count=523 data-injectable=true>The teenage genius uses Tony Stark’s ideas to make himself a suit, calling himself Iron Lad. Since the Avengers have disbanded, Nathaniel recruits several young heroes – such as Cassie Lang, Kate Bishop, Billy and Tommy – who call themselves the Young Avengers. During his time in the present, young Nathaniel and Cassie Lang develop feelings for one another. Nathaniel eventually realizes he needs to go back to his own timeline, but not before killing one of the many Kang variants and vowing to be a better person.</p><p data-characters=549 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>With the introduction of so many young heroes and Kang finally blasting his way into the MCU, now is the prime opportunity to introduce his younger self and form the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Young Avengers</a>. Based on Johnathan Majors take Kang, here are 10 actors who could believably step into what has to be among the most coveted roles in Hollywood right now. Since Cassie is currently around 18 years old and Kate Bishop is 22, Nathaniel could be cast as a college-aged young man and not necessarily a teenager. For that reason, we’re including actors from teens to 30.</p><h2 id=h-trey-sartorius data-injectable=false><strong>Trey Sartorius</strong></h2><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=334 data-injectable=false>The MCU has already cast Trey Sartorius as “Nate” Richards in the upcoming <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Agatha: Coven of Chaos.</a> Sartorius is a 19-year-old actor and social media personality who is known for his roles in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nickelodeon</a>’s Henry Danger and The Thundermans. His <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube channel</a>, where he creates short videos, has amassed 1.03 million subscribers.</p><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=753 data-injectable=true>Just because he’s been cast in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney Plus</a> series does not mean he will also be portraying him in the movies. As we know, Kang has many variants and, at the moment, we don’t even know if this is the Nathaniel Richards or a past relative. Although he doesn’t really look like Jonathan Majors, he has a great personality in his YouTube videos, which could definitely make him a good choice to play teenage Kang.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Dallas Dupree Young</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=644 data-injectable=true>Dallas Dupree Young is possibly the youngest actor on this list at 16. He is best known for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cobra Kai </a>and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ready Player One</a>. His role on Cobra Kai showcased his acting abilities, with his character being set up as a bullied teenager only to turn into one of the villains of the series. He has the ability to be likeable and scary within seconds.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Caleb McLaughlin</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true>One of the stars of the hit <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a> series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stranger Things</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Caleb McLaughlin</a> really had the opportunity to showcase his acting talents during the show’s fourth season. The role set him up to be one of the most sought-after young actors in Hollywood. He doesn’t resemble Jonathan Majors, a little makeup could go a long way in achieving the right look.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Tyler James Williams</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=654 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyler James Williams</a> is best known for portraying a young <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Rock</a> in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Everybody Hates Chris</a> and Gregory in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Abbott Elementary</a>. Although the actor is 30-years-old, he still looks in his early 20s, and young actors regularly play teenagers in television and movies. He has great facial expressions that could make him believably become Kang in the future.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Shameik Moore</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=711 data-injectable=true>If his name sounds familiar to you, it’s because <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shameik Moore</a> currently stars as the webslinger <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Miles Morales</a> in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</a>. Just because he currently portrays one superhero doesn’t mean he can’t be another, especially since his roles as Miles Morales is a voice acting role. Moore also stars as Sha and Raekwon in the highly acclaimed biographical drama Wu-Tang: An American Saga.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Tyrel Jackson Williams</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=632 data-injectable=true>Twenty-five-year-old<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Tyrel Jackson Williams</a> is the Kids Choice Awards nominated star of the Disney XD series, Lab Rats. He also starred as Charles alongside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hank Azaria</a> in Brockmire, where he was really able to showcase his acting talent.

He is also a very talented young actor who regularly steals every scene he in which he appears in Outer Banks. While his character, Pope Heyward, is the brains of the main protagonists, he has also had the opportunity to showcase his acting range.
