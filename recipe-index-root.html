I loved sampling salsas at restaurants and taco trucks. Each one was different â€“ some were made with roasted ingredients, others got a smoky, spicy kick from dried chiles, and still others were nice and fresh. This variety inspired me to start experimenting with making homemade salsa. I might pull out dried chiles in the winter, when good tomatoes are hard to find, or roast tomatillos if I see them at the farmers market. Butâ€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This Mediterranean quinoa salad recipe is fresh and flavorful. Itâ€™s a delicious addition to the menu of any potluck, cookout, or picnic. It can easily pass as a side dish, but itâ€™s so hearty and satisfying that it can be the main event, too. And if you happen to have leftovers, youâ€™re in luck! This quinoa salad keeps well if you make it ahead of time, so itâ€™s a great recipe to meal prep for healthy lunches throughout the week. Over the years, Iâ€™ve shared lots of quinoa salad recipes on the blog, but Iâ€™m especially smitten with this one.â€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Move over, bottled Italian dressing! This homemade Italian dressing recipe is super easy to make, and it tastes far better than any store bought kind. Trust me, I know. Growing up in the Midwest, I tried bottled Italian salad dressings left and right. They were a staple at the salad bar, the secret ingredient in everyoneâ€™s pasta salad, and the default marinade for any protein. I get it. Reaching for a bottle of pre-made dressing is quick and easy. But once you try this homemade Italian dressing recipe, youâ€™ll wonâ€™t look back. Itâ€™s a breeze to make, it uses simple,â€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Stuffed peppers are among the handful of dishes that will always remind me of being a kid. Growing up, they were a fixture in my momâ€™s regular recipe rotation, right alongside creamy broccoli soup, eggplant Parmesan, and mac and cheese. Back then, Iâ€™d eat the filling, made from ground beef, Italian seasoning, tomato sauce, and rice, and push aside the pepper. In hindsight, itâ€™s not hard to see why people were surprised when I became a vegetarian. ðŸ™‚ Since then, Iâ€™ve learned that the pepper itself is an integral part of any stuffed peppers recipe.&nbsp;Donâ€™t get me wrong, the fillingâ€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This edible cookie dough recipe is almost&nbsp;too&nbsp;easy to make. I donâ€™t know about you, but every so often, I have days when I need a cookie, and I need one now. Most of the time, I whip up my go-to vegan chocolate chip cookies, but lately, itâ€™s been too hot to turn on the oven. While I know that baking is out of the question on a sticky summer day, my cookie cravings couldnâ€™t care less. Enter: edible cookie dough. It has all the rich, chocolatey goodness of a regular cookie, but you donâ€™t have to turn on the ovenâ€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This grilled peaches recipe sums up everything about what makes cooking in late summer so special. Fresh peaches are already at their best â€“ sweet, juicy, and tender â€“ so the smallest effort transforms them into a delectable dessert. I love standing outside as they cook, soaking in the warm weather while itâ€™s still here. When theyâ€™re ready (they only take 3 minutes!), I scoop them off the grill, top them with vanilla ice cream, toasted nuts, and fresh herbs, and dig in while theyâ€™re still hot. If youâ€™ve never tried grilled peaches, I hope you make them in theâ€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Way back before Love and Lemons began, when I was first learning about seasonal vegetable cooking, grilled eggplant was one of my favorite things to make. Jack and I would visit farms near Austin, where we lived at the time, and come home with armfuls of summer veggies like zucchini and eggplant. Weâ€™d get the grill pan nice and hot (this was before we had an outdoor grill), and cook everything until it was tender and perfectly charred. Weâ€™d drizzle on a tasty sauce, pass some crusty bread, and call it dinner. So much has changed since then â€“ weâ€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Every time I make this ratatouille recipe, I think about a trip I took to Provence, France, a few years ago. While I was there, I stayed with a local family. When they met me at the train station, I was exhausted and hungry, worn out from hours of traveling alone. But when my hosts announced that they were serving ratatouille for dinner, I felt my energy come flooding back. Iâ€™ve always loved ratatouille, a ProvenÃ§al vegetable stew, and I was so excited to try it in France! That night, we sat on my hostsâ€™ patio, drinking rosÃ© and scoopingâ€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Who else loves yellow squash? Like zucchini, it starts to take over my fridge at this point in the summer, but I really canâ€™t complain. This tender, sunny summer squash is versatile, nourishing, and super easy to cook. I love to grill it, roast it, and even eat it raw, but lately, Iâ€™ve been hooked on this sautÃ©ed yellow squash recipe. Yellow squash itself has a mild flavor, so I toss it with a bright herb oil as soon as it comes off the heat. Then, I pile on a savory panko topping for crunch. Just a heads up â€“â€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Have you ever grilled watermelon? This summer, Iâ€™ve been grilling just about everything that enters my kitchen, and I finally got around to giving grilled watermelon a try. I have to say, Iâ€™m hooked! See, I love summer fruit like berries, cherries, peaches, and watermelon, but unlike Jack, whoâ€™s happy to eat an entire pint of blueberries in a single sitting, I rarely eat fruit on its own. More often, I use it as a sweet accent in savory dishes, like these summer rolls or this strawberry salad. So for me, grilling watermelon only makes it better. Its sweetness becomesâ€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>When I opened our CSA box last week and found jumbles of multicolored cherry tomatoes inside, I knew I had to make this cucumber tomato salad. Sometimes, I plan recipes months ahead of time. Green bean casserole for Thanksgiving, deviled eggs for Easter. But this cucumber tomato salad recipe was something I couldnâ€™t plan in advance. It rose out of those particular tomatoes and my particular craving for a flavorful summer salad that would show them off at their best. Since then, this cucumber tomato salad recipe has become a favorite in our house.
