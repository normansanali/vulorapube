When Gonzalez and Call Me by Your Name star <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Timothee Chalamet</strong></a>&nbsp;were spotted kissing in Mexico, she gained the mainstream media’s attention.</p><p>However, Timothee is not the first celebrity Eiza’s been linked with. It’s challenging not to fume with jealousy, so behold. Here is Eiza González’s boyfriend list, everyone she’s dated and was rumored to have dated. Hence, enjoy.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Pepe_Diaz></span>Pepe Diaz<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mexican actress, Eiza and Brazillian businessman <strong>Pepe Diaz</strong> dated for a couple of years in 2011. The former lovers were open about their relationship and often gushed their affection via social media.</p><p>However, Eiza and her ex-boyfriend called their romance off in 2013. The Sueña Conmigo actress confirmed their breakup via social media post in August, claiming they separated more than a month ago. However, Eiza further cleared that she was happy to close the cycle for another incredible one.</p><p>Interestingly, Eiza and Pepe had broken their relationship on different occasions, but they seemed to have mended it until it was beyond repair. Also, a few months later, an audio recording was released, which prove Eiza cheated on her ex-boyfriend with his brother, <strong>Jorge Diaz</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Pepe-Diaz-and-Eiza-Gonzalez-dated-for-a-year.jpg><p>In the audio record, the actress was heard talking about her relationship with Pepe. In addition, she was heard assuring Jorge was very bad in bed. Sounds typical, eh? Well, Eiza’s reps <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">confirmed that the recording</a> was manipulated. They further emphasized that the Eiza did not have anything to do with Jorge, and the audio was not directed towards Pepe’s brother. Finally, however, they admitted that it was Eiza’s voice.</p><p></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Liam_Hemsworth></span>Liam Hemsworth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Eiza sure has a taste for men as she was spotted with <strong>Miley Cyrus</strong>‘s ex-husband,<strong> Liam Hemsworth,</strong> after they called off their engagement for the first time.</p><p>Furthermore, Eiza and Liam were spotted making out in LA and partying at a Las Vegas nightclub. However, the spark was short-lived as Liam ended up reconciling with Miley in 2016.</p><p>On the other hand, Eiza refuses to talk about the relationship as she claims it unnecessary. Moreover, she sounded rather irked when she compared her ‘public figure’ circumstances with the school. She further explained that people know each other, and she’s linked to people because it’s her environment.</p><p>Gonzalez also seemed confused why her life choices and circles were such a big thing. Nevertheless, she moved on from the Australian actor happily.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=DJ_Cotrona></span>D.J. Cotrona<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>What the world can never stop talking about is Global Warming and two hot celebrities dating. So yes, when Mexican actress, Eiza and American actor<strong> D.J. Cotrona</strong> made their relationship official while working in From Dusk Till Dawn, & their chemistry dropped jaws. Furthermore, they confirmed their romance after Labor Day Weekend in 2014.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>A post shared by @eizagonzalez</a></p><p>Sadly, the heat between the hot couple lasted for about a year between 2014 and 2015. Also, both Cotrona and Eiza remained tight-lipped about their relationship and did not disclose the reason behind their break-up.</p><p>Therefore, we can only hope if Eiza and D.J. Cotrona broke up amicably. Regardless, Cotrona is not the only D.J. she’s dated so far.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Calvin_Harris></span>Calvin Harris<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Actress Eiza and producer <strong>Calvin Harris</strong> sparked relationship rumors after being spotted in 2016. Them walking arm in arm fueled that fire.</p><p>According to E! News, Calvin, and Eiza were not hiding their feelings after arriving together at a house party.

Well, being affectionate isn’t always a crime.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Maluma></span>Maluma<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While talking about romance with musician, actress Eiza also sparked dating rumors with the Colombian singer, Maluma. The relationship assumptions started after Eiza’s supposed partner, <strong>Maluma</strong>, joined her at a nightclub in LA.</p><p>Moreover, the former pair were spotted at LA’s Avenue nightclub a month after sparking the romance rumor. According to TV Notas, they were dating since July 2017. However, their relationship was a bit complicated due to their hectic schedule.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Giaz-and-Maluma-had-a-fling.jpg><p>As it was put by the close friend, the former pair are pretty flirtatious and weren’t serious as they did not believe their romance would last. However, he also added other casualties like distance, strong personalities that prevented Eiza and Maluma from committing.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Josh_Duhamel></span>Josh Duhamel<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Amongst the dates and dating rumors, Eiza also dated Unsolved star <strong>Josh Duhamel</strong>.

Moreover, they were face timing and texting nonstop.

Furthermore, Eiza was allegedly joined by the suave Portuguese footballer at a Hollywood Warwick nightclub party the same month.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Cristiano-and-Gonzalez-were-spotted-together-in-a-party.jpg><p>However, the supposed pair parted the venue separately, and they never addressed the speculation. Cristiano is with his long-time girlfriend, Spanish model<strong> Georgina Rodriguez, </strong>and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>enjoying fatherhood</a>.</p><p>On the other hand, Eiza Gonzalez is still sparking romance rumors & searching for Mr. Perfect.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Timothee_Chalamet></span>Timothée Chalamet<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Academy Award nominee&nbsp;Timothée Chalamet and Mexican actress Gonzalez created a massive buzz in the media after TMZ spotted the pair-making in Cabo, Mexico, in June 2020.</p><p>According to TMZ, the romance did not end with a kiss as he picked up a guitar while they were hanging poolside and started jamming.

Their affair lasted as long as their 5-day Mexican vacation. Hence, their summer romance did not even make it to fall, let alone mere mention of Gonzalez during the winter interview with GQ.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Dusty_Lachowicz></span>Dusty Lachowicz<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mexican actress Gonzalez <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">sparked rumors</a> about her love life when she was spotted with <strong>Dusty Lachowicz</strong>.
