That must be where they first met. The date was around 2008.</p><p>Fast forward a few years (because we do not know the story in between), Michaela and Mike married each other on 3 July 2011. They celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary this year. And every year on their anniversary either Michaela or Mike has something poetic to say about each other.</p><p>On their 9th wedding anniversary, Michaela posted a photo on her Instagram with the words ‚ÄúForever and ever and ever. #happyanniversary #9‚Äù</p><p>The previous year, Mike had posted a photo from their wedding with a poem (Amor) by Pablo Neruda and under the poem, ‚ÄúHappy Anniversary, Sweet. Thanks for braving the woods with me.‚Äù</p><p>Apart from the anniversary posts, Mike Tweeted things like, ‚ÄúSometimes I take for granted how out-of-my-league my wife is. And then she gets new headshots.‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúThanking past-life-me for whatever heroic feat earned me this perfect wife‚Ä¶‚Äù</p><p>Based on those Tweets, it seems Mike and Michaela have the happiest marriage two famous successful people can have.</p><p>In the 10 years of their married life, Mike and Michaela had two sons, Gabriel October Daniels and Declan Griffith Daniels. Gabriel, the elder one, was born on 3 April 2014; and Declan was born in September 2016.</p><p>They also had their third and youngest child in May 2021.

Welcome to the world, Indie Irene.</p><p>And Mike was a very good father to his children or so says Michaela. And during a 2019 interview, she also talked about her experiences as a mother.</p><p>Since becoming a mom, everything has changed! I don‚Äôt even know who I was before my kids were born‚Ä¶Being a mother is the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done but it‚Äôs also the most rewarding‚Ä¶I try to enjoy every moment because they grow up so fast‚Ä¶They‚Äôre my everything.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Mike Daniels?</strong></h3><p>As of 2021, Mike Daniels was in his late 30s.
