Getting the right audition at the right time for the right role can change everything, and once a person has success in &nbsp;acting, it is rare to see people walk away. Just imagine a lead actor from a franchise like the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MCU</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DC</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Star Wars</a> just calling it a day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kal Penn was able to find success as a young actor, but eventually, he would walk away from his lucrative profession and spend his time working as part of something much bigger than just a film project.</p><p>Let’s take a look at Kal Penn’s reason to leave acting behind!</p><h2 id=kal-penn-found-success-in-movies-like-harold-amp-kumar>Kal Penn Found Success In Movies Like Harold & Kumar</h2><p>To get the full picture of Kal Penn and his eventually decision to leave acting behind, we need to get a feel for what he was able to accomplish as a performer. After spending years landing small roles in film and on television, Penn would gain notoriety in the film&nbsp;Van Wilder before becoming a star in his own right.</p><p>Van Wilder&nbsp;was a success for Penn, but once he was cast as a lead in the film&nbsp;Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, things really started to take off for the performer. That film was just what the doctor ordered for comedy fans, and while the overall premise is nothing short of silly, the film wound up netting a huge audience and becoming a success for Penn and John Cho.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After breaking out with the first&nbsp;Harold & Kumar film, Penn was able to keep the ball rolling. He starred in two more&nbsp;Harold & Kumar&nbsp;films, got his own&nbsp;Van Wilder sequel, and eventually transitioned to television. Once he was on the small screen, Penn would snag a lead role on the hit series&nbsp;House, which took things to another level for the successful actor.</p><p>Despite all of the success that he was able to find as a performer, Penn had his eyes set on something much, much different. His success in the world of acting and his background were instrumental in doors opening up for the performer, and once it was announced that he was leaving acting behind, people quickly began to speculate why in the world he would ditch a successful gig.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Neil Patrick Harris: 10 Things You Didn’t Know About Him</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-walked-away-to-work-for-president-obama>He Walked Away To Work For President Obama</h2><p>With acting in the rearview mirror, Kal Penn soon transitioned to working in the White House with President Obama. This was major news that quickly caught headlines, and while there are plenty of stars who like to sink their teeth into politics, this was simply on an entirely different level.</p><p>When asked about his decision, Penn would say, “It seemed like something I would enjoy doing. I figured it was something to do."</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>, Penn would be working with the Obama administration as “an associate director for the Obama administration's Office of Public Liaison.”</p><p>Penn did make it clear that his decision was going to land him working alongside President Obama for one to two years and that he was not done with acting forever. It was a temporary job that he was genuinely interested in doing. It is impressive to see someone pursue something they are passionate about instead of going through the motions in something that they have been doing for years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After spending time with the Obama administration, it was time for Penn to head back to Hollywood with a different perspective and a desire to hop back in the saddle.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebrity Exes Who Had To Work Together After Their Breakup</a></span></p><h2 id=he-made-a-return-to-acting>He Made A Return To Acting</h2><p>Penn concluded his time in the White House back in 2011, and when speaking about his time there, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he would tell ABC</a>, “You're standing there at midnight at the South portico and it's freezing cold outside and you're receiving a painting for the president that he's going to give to a world leader. You kind of take a moment and kind of realize where you are -- it's humbling.”</p><p>Penn was able to do things that virtually no actor in history got to do while there, and once he was back on the acting trail, he made sure to pick up right where he left off before he went to work for President Obama.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;IMDb, Penn has appeared in projects like&nbsp;The Big Bang Theory,&nbsp;New Girl, and&nbsp;Designated Survivor since returning from his political journey.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Close Are Kal Penn And John Cho?</a></span></p><p>Walking away from Hollywood is no easy feat, but Penn was able to pursue a dream of his while still being able to come back and pick up right where he left off.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Prime Special ‘Yearly Departed’ Is The Perfect Response To Sexist Comedy Stereotypes</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalecqao2aolaO7bsPApaJmmaeWxm6y0aikZpmTqbavs44%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./beautiful-things-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                    Gungor                                          Beautiful Things lyrics  ">&larr;
