Restoration is taking the past and using it to propel me into the now which is, “How do I feel right now about being a part of this band?” It’s exhilarating and terrifying. It’s a lot of work. I’m spending more time as a musician than I ever have. Being an artist is like breathing. It’s as easy to me as you write.”&nbsp;<strong>– Wynonna Judd&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“No, I don’t, because Cactus is that. Cactus is the leader. I get to just show up and get away with singing. You know what’s really great, sometimes? Letting go. Letting go of the idea of having to be in control. That really was a lifesaver. After his accident, I became Mrs. Moser.”&nbsp;<strong>– Wynonna Judd&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“Sonically, I wanted to make a record that sounds as interesting as it is musical. It’s a little bit more of a soundtrack where the music speaks a little more. We used these very distinctive 1930s drums that I played on the whole record. The band all started to react to that instrument and it changed the feel and instrumentation that they played with.”&nbsp;<strong>– Wynonna Judd&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“That’s exactly what I wanted. When I walked away, I felt like I had no idea about the record and how it was going to sound. When I heard him come into the room and put on my headphones and play me Timothy B. [Schmit] singing his favorite Poco memories into this song.”&nbsp;<strong>– Wynonna Judd&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“It’s a really special time of making connections that are sacred, that have nothing to do with guys sitting in a board room putting together two artists because they know it’s going to be number one.”&nbsp;<strong>– Wynonna Judd&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>3 Powerful Lessons from Wynonna Judd</h2><p>Now that you know all about Wynonna Judd’s net worth and how she achieved success; let’s take a look at some of the lessons we can learn from her:</p><h3>1.
