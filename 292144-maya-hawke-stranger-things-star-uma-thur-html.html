She is the daughter of two showbiz icons. Find out who Hawke's parents are and more details about the actress.</p><p class=dh>When the first part of "Stranger Things" season four debuted in May 2022, it was a bittersweet experience for viewers, as the thought of waiting for the second volume was quite draining. Finally, after much anticipation, the series' final two episodes <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a40460317/stranger-things-season-4-finale-explained-review/>have landed</a>. They were released on July 1, 2022.</p><p class=dh>Many are happy to see their favorites back on the screen, one of which is Maya Hawke. An American actress and model, Hawke plays the role of Robin Buckley in the series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/c8c85f5cb911dac383834efdc2868ba1.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Maya Hawke attends the Christian Dior Haute Couture Fall/Winter 2019/2020 show as part of Paris Fashion Week | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>After her team-up with Steve in season three, Buckley was given an expanded role as a full-fledged gang member in the fourth season. Hopefully, she made another big impression with her screen time on the Netflix series.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MAYA HAWKE IS UMA THURMAN'S DAUGHTER</strong></p><p class=dh>Hawke is undoubtedly a talented actress; however, many are oblivious to facts about the star's personal life away from her career. For example, she is the daughter of renowned actress, producer, and fashion model Uma Thurman.</p><p class=dh>Over the years, Hawke has spoken candidly about her mother and how much she has been affected by Thurman's decisions. During a recent episode of "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon," the "Stranger Things'' star was at it again. This time, she spoke about her mom's abortion and the impact.</p><p class=dh>Hawke surprisingly <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Por1MeYwKlU">revealed</a> that she would not exist if her mother did not get an abortion in her younger years. According to the actress, abortion saved her parents' lives and helped them pursue their dreams.</p><p class=dh>Many years after Thurman's supposed abortion, she gave birth to her beautiful daughter. Being born to an icon allowed Hawke to meet famous people from a tender age, including Jimmy Fallon, who claims he carried the young actress as a baby.</p><p class=dh>Although Hawke has spoken about her mom countless times, many did not know she was Thurman's daughter until recently. "Only found out yesterday that Maya Hawke is Uma Thurman's daughter, and now I can't stop thinking about the resemblance," a Twitter user recently <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/salanghae707/status/1542772037449662464>posted</a>. Another <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/danafooz/status/1542862740888457216>wrote</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Dudeâ€¦ how am I just finding out Maya Hawke's parents are UMA THURMAN AND ETHAN HAWKE."</p><p class=dh>A third user <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/neilasromeo/status/1542578343958159360>noted</a> that Hawke was such a perfect combination of both her parents, which was scary, while a fourth user <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/melissaztweets/status/1542558488378875908>wrote</a>, "Waitâ€¦ Am I the only one who didn't know Robin from Stranger Things (Maya Hawke) is Uma Thurman's daughter?! ðŸ¤¯."</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>DID MAYA HAWKE'S PARENTS APPROVE OF HER CAREER?</strong></p><p class=dh>The answer is yes! During an interview with The Guardian, the actress revealed that, at first, her parents were cautious about the public life side of acting and tried to protect her from falling into acting. But in due time, they supported her when they found out it was Hawke's passion.</p><p class=dh>Born to two movie stars, Hawke looks up to her parents a lot. She loves watching their movies, especially the happy ones. The young actress told the outlet that one of her favorite movies of her mom is "The Producers."</p><p class=dh>Meanwhile, besides acting, Hawke is also a musician. She loves singing and writing songs as much as she loves acting. In October last year, the young star revealed she had something in the works musically and was thrilled to share it with the world.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MAYA HAWKE ON THE IMPACT OF HER "STRANGER THINGS" CHARACTER</strong></p><p class=dh>One of the things that brought so much attention to Maya Hawke's character in "Stranger Things" was when Robin Buckley came out as a lesbian in season three. While some were unhappy, others applauded the writers.</p><p class=dh>During the interview with The Guardian, Hawke was asked if it got a good response from viewers. Replying, the actress <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/oct/31/maya-hawke-mainstream-interview-stranger-things>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Recently someone told me they watched that season with their daughter. During that episode, they both started crying, then the daughter came out to the mother. I credit the Duffer brothers [Stranger Things creators] for writing such a great character."</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Hawke</a> had previously revealed that Robin was not originally written as a queer character. According to her, they started to <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.eonline.com/news/1336277/how-maya-hawkes-fast-talking-shaped-her-stranger-things-character>feel like</a> she was gay and should not get together with Steve throughout the filming. Thankfully, it was a good idea, making the series successful.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwa2lkaXqurdiaZKGZp6Cybr%2FTq5inn5WnerW0yKeerGWjqa6zedSmmGasmKq%2Fb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./new-guardians-galaxy-vol-2-concept-art-focuses-baby-adolescent-groot.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="New Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 Concept Art Focuses On Baby And Adolescent Groot">&larr;
