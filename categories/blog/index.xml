It is not recommended to combine a large number of different heads on a single zone, although people do this all of the time to water shrubs or flowers in existing zones.
As a result, is it possible to add a sprinkler head to an existing zone? To get from the new valve to the new sprinkler head positions, you‚Äôll need to dig a trench. It is recommended that the trenches be 2 to 3 inches deeper than the usual depth of frozen ground in the region, or a minimum of 6 inches in depth.</description></item><item><title>Christian Glvez Wife: Meet Patricia Pardo</title><link>/christian-galvez-wife-meet-patricia-pardo.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/christian-galvez-wife-meet-patricia-pardo.html</guid><description>Christian G√°lvez Wife: Meet Patricia Pardo&amp;nbsp;‚Äì In this piece you will get to know all about Christian G√°lvez wife.
